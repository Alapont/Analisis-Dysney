COACH BOLTON:  We’ve dug ourselves a hole, and the only way out is on each other’s shoulders. No more X’s and O’s. Forget the scoreboard. Here’s the number that means something……Sixteen minutes left in the game……the season……and for the seniors on this squad……sixteen minutes left in a Wildcats uniform. Captains?
TROY:  Hey, you heard Coach. The sixteen minutes are going to stay with us for a long time after we leave East High……so it’s now or never. Chad?
CHAD:  What team?
TEAM:  Wildcats!
CHAD:  What team?
TEAM:  Wildcats!
CHAD:  What team?
TEAM:  Wildcats!
TROY:  Did anyone actually wash their lucky socks? The same socks we’ve worn for three straight playoff games……games we won?
CHAD:  Mine never left my locker all season
JASON:  I kept mine in my lunch bag
TROY:  Zeke?
ZEKE:  I vacuum-packed mine
TROY:  That’s what I’m talking about!
COACH BOLTON:  Jimmie Z, you’re in!
TROY:  Save it for the game, Rocketman, and keep your eyes on me
CHAD:  So……what’d you think of the game?
MRS. DANFORTH:  Did you have to take it down to the buzzer? I was a nervous wreck!
TROY:  Back-to-back championships!
MRS. BOLTON:  Fantastic! But you’re still helping us clean up after the party.
ZEKE:  They’re cooling. I’ll let you know when they’re ready! Out of my kitchen, mister!
TROY:  Hey! Fix you a plate?
GABRIELLA:  One of everything
COACH BOLTON:  Coach Kellog, you got any empty lockers up at U of A?
COACH KELLOG:  Not for long I hope
COACH BOLTON:  I bet Charlie Danforth will suit up for you next season, too, if you just ask him
MR. DANFORTH:  A front-row seat will do just fine
COACH KELLOG:  Well, the kind of team play I saw tonight goes a long way with me, and we’re counting on seeing you both in Redhawk uniforms next season, right?
CHAD:  Done deal
MR. DANFORTH:  Amen to that, son!
JIMMIE:  Dude, great house! Your room is way cool!
TROY:  You were in my room?
JIMMIE:  I took a picture. Look. I’m doing mine the same way.
TROY:  Wow. That’s great, Jimmie. Oh, man, I left the championship trophy in my truck……I hope it’s still there……
JIMMIE:  Don’t worry, I’m on it!
TROY:  One of everything. Your wish is my command. Now follow me.
GABRIELLA:  Another top secret hiding place?
TROY:  You are the second girl ever allowed up here
TROY:  The other was my mom, and she only climbed up to get me down. I haven’t been up here since I was ten……
TROY:  Okay……thirteen
TROY:  All right, last week. When I was nervous about the game
GABRIELLA:  Well, I’m honored. And ready for these……
GABRIELLA:  Was that the coach from U of A down there?
GABRIELLA:  I bet he’s already got your name on a locker
TROY:  Yeah, it’s always been my dad’s dream that I end up at his alma matter
GABRIELLA:  My mom and I have been talking about Stanford University ever since I was born
TROY:  And you’re already accepted. That’s so cool
GABRIELLA:  Except my mom won’t stop talking about it. It’s embarrassing
TROY:  She’s proud of you. So am I. Everyone is
GABRIELLA:  The thing about Stanford is that it’s a thousand and……
TROY & GABRIELLA:  Fifty-three miles……
TROY:  From here. I know. And now the rest of the school year is coming at us so fast.
GABRIELLA:  I wish it would all just……stop. At least, slow down.
MRS. BOLTON:  Troy, you have guests! Hi, Gabriella!
SHARPAY:  Hi, Troy! When’s the big game?
TROY:  Yesterday
SHARPAY:  Well, good luck! Toodles!
SHARPAY:  What are you? I mean who are you?
TIARA:  Good morning, Miss Evans. I’m Tiara Gold. I’ve just transferred to East High from London and noticed on the board that you were in need of a personal assistant?
SHARPAY:  Well, with finals, prom, and graduation, I need someone tracking my appointments and assignments. Most important, I need someone to run lines with me for the spring musical. That’s a theater term for……
TIARA:  Learning your role. I understand. It’s best to keep science and math together, since those are your first classes of the day
SHARPAY:  How do you know my schedule?
TIARA:  I took the liberty of checking, simply to make certain I’d have your nonfat, no-foam soy latte ready for free period
SHARPAY:  One packet of sweetener
TIARA:  Organic, of course
SHARPAY:  I’ll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each morning so that our outfits won’t clash. By the way, I like the accent
JIMMIE:  Troy, my brother, can I have your gym locker?
TROY:  What?
JIMMIE:  Like……starting next week? It’ll help me with the guys next season if you do that
TROY:  Why didn’t I think of that?
JIMMIE:  Oh, man! Another tardy
SHARPAY:  Oh, you can go now
TIARA:  I managed to transfer into your homeroom. Just in case I could be of service
SHARPAY:  Some people might be freaked out by you. Me……I like it. Take a seat.
MISS DARBUS:  All right, settle down. I know we’re all still excited about the Wildcat’s top-to-bottom championship……
CHAD:  That would be back-to-back, Miss D!
MISS DARBUS:  In any case, it was a grand slam! Well done! Now, student body president and co-editor of the yearbook, Taylor McKessie has important announcements. Taylor?
TAYLOR:  Senior-trip subcommittee meets tomorrow and reports Thursday to prom committee, headed by Martha……Pick up your prom tickets from her. Graduation committee convenes Monday, following yearbook planning. Picture deadline is Thursday. Finals study groups alternate with all of the above. Questions?
CHAD:  What’s the lunch special in the cafeteria today?
TAYLOR:  New York Deli. Anyone else?
MISS DARBUS:  Moving on. Sharpay Evans, four-term Drama Club co-president……spring musical report?
SHARPAY:  With prom, finals, and everyone being so busy, we’ll select something very modest to perform. Perhaps even a one-woman show.
MISS DARBUS:  A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?
KELSI:  Oh, no, actually we’re doing pretty well……
MISS DARBUS:  Well, well, well……almost the entire homeroom. How inspiring!
MISS DARBUS:  So, I’ll be seeing all of you during free period to discuss the show, and for a very special announcement……
TROY:  Leave it to Darbus to make free period mandatory
JASON:  I’ll be retaking my finals two or three times. I’m moving into the library
TROY:  Kels, I was going to be using free period to work on my truck
ZEKE:  I’ve got five new recipes to nail for my Family Science final
TAYLOR:  We’ve got a yearbook to edit. So no can do.
KELSI:  Sorry. I just thought since it was the last show, everyone would want to do it
GABRIELLA:  Hey. Listen up! Kelsi’s right! We should do this. Jason……Taylor, Martha and I can help you study. Zeke……we’re your official tasters. This is our last chance to do something together, all of us. Something really fun.
SHARPAY:  Oh, yippie
TAYLOR:  But how much time will it take?
CHAD:  And what is the show about?
MISS DARBUS:  You, Mr. Danforth. The spring musical is all about……you
CHAD:  Me?
MISS DARBUS:  It’s about all of you. And all of you will create it……a show about your last days at East High. We’ll call it……Senior Year!
SHARPAY:  Genius
MISS DARBUS:  Kelsi will compose, Ryan choreograph……and I’ll do my best to guide you. Now, important news from The Juilliard School in New York City, America’s preeminent college for the performing arts. Yes, for the first time in East High history, four of you are being considered for one available theater arts scholarship. Yes, Juilliard is considering Miss Sharpay Evans……
SHARPAY:  I’m already packed
MISS DARBUS:  Mr. Ryan Evans……
MISS DARBUS:  Miss Kelsi Nielsen……
KELSI:  Whoa! They got my letter!
MISS DARBUS:  Indeed they did, and finally……Mr. Troy Bolton. Juilliard will send representatives to observe our spring show. So……good luck to our four applicants!
TROY:  All right……who’s the big comedian? Ha, ha, ha. Pretty good, dude
MISS DARBUS:  Is there something wrong?
TROY:  I didn’t apply. I’ve never heard of……Juilliard
MISS DARBUS:  Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton, but, evidently, Juilliard has heard of you, and as you create this show, then you must dig down and think about your aspirations, your dreams for the future. Line up, please. Let’s begin with Mr. Danforth
CHAD:  My dreams? U of A. Hoops all the way!
MISS DARBUS:  Miss McKessie?
TAYLOR:  My future? I’d like to be president of the United States.
JASON:  Do we get extra credit for just……like……showing up?
KELSI:  To write some songs we’ll remember……
MISS DARBUS:  Martha Cox, you’re late!
MARTHA:  I had my American Folk Dance class……and thought maybe we could use a few more dancers……
MISS DARBUS:  I’m feeling the show already! Troy Bolton?
TROY:  To bust whoever signed me up for this!
MISS DARBUS:  And Miss Montez?
GABRIELLA:  I think we should stage the perfect prom
SHARPAY:  That’s adorable! What do I want? Gosh, I wouldn’t know where to begin……but I know where it ends. Center stage, a single spotlight……a huge marquee that reads……
RYAN:  I’ll have the New York Deli Platter, please, double cheese. And throw in that “Big Apple” parfait……if they make it there, I’ll eat anywhere.
SHARPAY:  How can you think of food at a time like this?
RYAN:  Maybe because it’s lunchtime
SHARPAY:  I’m talking about the show, Ryan! That puppy dog Troy Bolton pretended to know nothing about Juilliard
RYAN:  Troy looked genuinely surprised
SHARPAY:  Oh, so the theater fairy magically sent in Troy’s application? Performers can’t fool me, Ryan. They’re deceitful, ambitious and ruthless!
RYAN:  Aren’t we……performers?
SHARPAY:  Exactly!
RYAN:  Wait a minute……Ms. D. said there’s only one scholarship available
SHARPAY:  We’re twins. They’ll have to take us both. Kelsi always writes her best songs for Troy and Gabriella. So you make certain we get those songs
RYAN:  How?
SHARPAY:  Polish her glasses. Buy her some ruby slippers. I don’t know. Just do it!
GABRIELLA:  Coming to rehearsal today?
TAYLOR:  Do I have a choice? You got us into this. Which I don’t understand. Have you even told anyone you’re up for Stanford’s freshman honors program?
TAYLOR:  You’re going to hear from them any day
GABRIELLA:  I already heard from them
TROY:  Look up
GABRIELLA:  Huh?
GABRIELLA:  Gotta go!
TROY:  You’ve got to help me with this. Which one should I wear?
GABRIELLA:  Because……?
TROY:  You’re going to have a beautiful dress, and I want to look right.
GABRIELLA:  I’ve never been asked to a prom, but this almost sounds like an invitation
TROY:  Will we have to waltz? I really don’t know how to do that
GABRIELLA:  All I know is what my dad showed me when I was a little girl. I’d stand on his toes, and he’d waltz me around the living room. Come here
TROY:  Is that a yes?
GABRIELLA:  Yes in every language!
TROY:  Yo, Rocketman……
TROY:  You guys wanted our lockers?
CHAD:  Well, it’s moving day!
JIMMIE:  Sweet!
DONNY:  Hey, joke’s over, guys!
GABRIELLA:  Yearbook opportunity!
TAYLOR:  Got it!
MISS DARBUS:  Bold choice, gentleman, bold choice. We must all have the courage to discover ourselves. However, at East High, we’ll discover ourselves while clothed. But welcome to our spring musical. And on with the show.
TROY:  If my truck falls apart because I’m spending my free time onstage, it’s all on you
GABRIELLA:  Me?
TROY:  You think I’d be up there if it wasn’t for you?
GABRIELLA:  Yeah, I do
GABRIELLA:  Troy, I watched you in rehearsal. You love it. Why is that so hard for you to admit?
TROY:  It isn’t to you. But to my dad? To Chad? Yeah, that’s a little hard.
GABRIELLA:  It shouldn’t be
TROY:  They’re happy as long as we’re talking about U of A. You chose Stanford……U of A was sort of chosen for me. I haven’t been talking about this with anyone……but I’ve had offers from other colleges. And I’m really listening.
GABRIELLA:  I get it, Troy. I’ve still got decisions to make, too.
TROY:  Like what?
MRS. MONTEZ:  I’ve got snacks for you inside……I think I interrupted something
GABRIELLA:  Just talking, Mom
TAYLOR:  Kissing up to the yearbook editors. Very smart move.
TROY:  Chad’s hoping for two pages for himself. Maybe even a third page, just for his hair.
CHAD:  Hey, what’s right is right. Hoops, by the way, you’ve got to take me after school to check out the whole tuxedo thing.
TROY:  I’m definitely an expert
TAYLOR:  Tuxedo? What for?
CHAD:  Um……prom?
TAYLOR:  Honey, if that’s what you call a formal invitation, you’ll be dancing with yourself
SHARPAY:  Yes! No……No……Yes……No. How many have I approved?
TIARA:  Sixty-seven
SHARPAY:  That’ll do. Deliver those to the yearbook room
ZEKE:  Hey Sharpay
SHARPAY:  Zeke! Cookies? Oh, you don’t have cookies
ZEKE:  Um……Sharpay……there’s something I’ve been wanting to ask you for about a year……
SHARPAY:  Oh, Zeke, glad you stopped by. You’re taking me to prom. Don’t buy a corsage, it’s being flown in from Hawaii
TIARA:  I’ve sent the florist a fabric swatch
SHARPAY:  Daddy will arrange limousine and restaurant
SHARPAY:  Your tuxedo will be delivered, but don’t wear it to your ballroom-dance lessons.
ZEKE:  Dance lessons?
SHARPAY:  Beginning Monday. Questions? No. Good. Toodles!
JASON:  Well?
ZEKE:  I didn’t even give her a chance to say no
TROY:  Now or never, dude
CHAD:  Okay, okay. I’m going in
TROY:  The Garden Club is rooting for you
CHAD:  So, anyway, I was really hoping you’d kind of go to the prom with me
TAYLOR:  Oh, hi, Chad. Hey, they’ve got Tuna Surprise on the menu. Your favorite.
CHAD:  The prom. I’m asking you.
TAYLOR:  It’s so loud in here. You’ll have to speak up.
CHAD:  Taylor McKessie, will you please be my date to the senior prom?
TAYLOR:  I’d be honored
CHAD:  Dude, I need to go shoot some hoops. Right away
TROY:  Horse!
CHAD:  Go again?
TROY:  Dude, we can shoot hoops all day, but we still got to get you into a tuxedo. No way out, man.
MISS DARBUS:  Kelsi, the music is splendid, Ryan, your choreography is most inventive. Jason, we don’t chew gum in the theater……
SHARPAY:  I heard she’s writing something amazing for Troy and Gabriella
RYAN:  A song, most likely
SHARPAY:  Find out what it is!
RYAN:  So, hey, how can we make this whole show better? Maybe we could get together?
KELSI:  I’m in the music room every morning as soon as they unlock the school. Actually, I have my own key, but don’t tell anyone. It’s really early but……I do have a teapot. Come on by!
JIMMIE:  Hey, good job, Troy!
TROY:  Stop doing that! Look, there’s Sharpay! You didn’t hear this from me, but she has a secret crush on you.
MISS DARBUS:  Mr. Zara?
JIMMIE:  Call me Rocketman if you want to
MISS DARBUS:  How generous, and since you’ve been such a……dedicated presence here, I’m making you an understudy.
MISS DARBUS:  Tiara, you as well
JIMMIE:  I’m in! Hey, Donny, I’m IN!!! I’m playing understudy
DONNY:  Way cool. You rock, Jimmie Z!
TIARA:  Understudy isn’t a role, you morons. It means you go on if one of the leads can’t make it for the performance.
JIMMIE:  Oh. Well, you’re one, too.
TIARA:  The difference being I can actually carry a tune
JIMMIE:  Hey, I wouldn’t sing with you if my hair was on fire and you were the last bucket of water on the Earth
TIARA:  And I wouldn’t sing with you if I were starving and you were the last pickle at the picnic
JIMMIE:  Want to have lunch sometime?
TAYLOR:  Stanford University’s freshman honors program cordially……
TAYLOR:  Just tell me you’ve already said yes……right?
GABRIELLA:  I haven’t even told my mom I got the letter.
TIARA:  They select only thirty freshmen from the entire incoming class. It’s a special three-week honors program.
SHARPAY:  How prestigious
TIARA:  But the program starts in two weeks! She’d miss our……your show.
SHARPAY:  Oh, my goodness! What to do? Well, the show must go on……mustn’t it?
RYAN:  Kind of beautiful
KELSI:  Stuck on the bridge. Worried about the show……
RYAN:  Shouldn’t be. It’s sounding good. The prom number was great. So is this one. So……what are you doing prom night?
KELSI:  It’s two days before the dhow. I’ll be working on charts and fixing orchestrations and probably changing song lyrics right up until……
RYAN:  Good. Pick you up at eight.
RYAN:  Pity the actor who has to follow that in the show. Wait. It might be me.
GABRIELLA:  The way you dance, you’ve got no worries
TROY:  Yeah, we’re all trying to catch up with you
SHARPAY:  Ryan? Did you get a copy of that song from Kelsi?
RYAN:  No, but I’m taking her to prom!
SHARPAY:  Brilliant! Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Now, get me that duet!
RYAN:  Um……last time I checked, you’re not Gabriella
SHARPAY:  Don’t be so sure
TAYLOR:  You should be throwing a party, not keeping a secret
GABRIELLA:  But it starts at Stanford next week! I’ll miss everything!
TAYLOR:  You’ll come back for prom and graduation. You had enough credits to graduate from East High last December. Sister, your future is calling, loud and clear!
GABRIELLA:  Stop being my mom for a second and just be my friend! Maybe I like it here. Maybe I want to stay in Albuquerque as long as possible. Maybe I’ll just stay here next year.
TAYLOR:  What?!!
TROY:  My fuel pump is deceased, Mr. Riley
MR. RILEY:  Dig around, you’ll find one here. Can’t wait to see you guys play for U of A next year. Already bought my season tickets. Lock up when you leave.
CHAD:  Hear that? Season tickets. Time to start practicing, dude
TROY:  Take a breather, LeBron. Man, don’t you ever feel like your entire life is already being laid out for you?
CHAD:  What’s your point?
TROY:  I just want my future to be……my future
CHAD:  See what happens when you do a show? You’re like……five people.
TROY:  What’s so bad about that? When we used to come here as kids, we’d be ten people! Spies, superheroes, rock stars……we were whatever we wanted to be, whenever we wanted to be it. It was us, man!
CHAD:  We were eight years old. And for the record, I was a much better superhero than you.
CHAD:  What are you going to do if Juilliard says yes?
TROY:  I don’t know
CHAD:  That’s not what I wanted to hear. I’m getting you back in the gym tomorrow
TAYLOR:  Stay in Albuquerque? That makes no sense
GABRIELLA:  And why do I always have to make sense? I’ll still go to Stanford. But maybe in a year. I can take classes at U of A. I don’t know
TAYLOR:  U of A? You’re not thinking clearly, because you’re thinking about Troy. He’s your first crush. But there’ll be more boys, more Troys.
COACH BOLTON:  First U of A game is at home against Trinity, but the next game is away……against Tulane.
MRS. BOLTON:  That’s New Orleans, right?
MR. DANFORTH:  Road trip!
MRS. MONTEZ:  High school feels like the most important thing in the world. When you’re in it. But that changes.
GABRIELLA:  Not everything has to change, Mom. I don’t believe it.
TROY:  Okay, prom corsages. Take your pick, because if you leave it up to me……well……
GABRIELLA:  If you pick it out, I’m going to like it. Unless it’s that one
SHARPAY:  Hi, Troy! I realized I haven’t offered my congratulations
TROY:  Thanks, but to tell you the truth, I’m glad the season’s over
SHARPAY:  I didn’t mean basketball, silly, I meant Gabriella
TROY:  Huh?
SHARPAY:  Her missing the show is a little disappointing. But being selected for Stanford’s freshman honors program……well, that’s amazing for her.
TROY:  I don’t know what you’re talking about
SHARPAY:  Everyone else does. The whole school is buzzing. The honorees get to spend time with Stanford’s top professors in special classes. Starting next week.
TROY:  Next week?
SHARPAY:  You really didn’t know? Okay, this is a little awkward. I guess her not telling you means she’s on the fence about it, but who better than Troy Bolton to encourage her to accept that honor, since the only thing possibly holding her back is……you
TROY:  Pizza’s here
GABRIELLA:  I didn’t order pizza
TROY:  You didn’t have to. Half vegetarian, half everything else. Oh, and let’s not forget……what’s a picnic without chocolate-covered strawberries?
GABRIELLA:  You are one crazy Wildcat
TROY:  So, here’s the thing. Your freshmen honors program at Stanford……
GABRIELLA:  How’d you hear about that?
TROY:  A lot of people heard about it, but I wasn’t one of them. Why?
GABRIELLA:  Because I never knew what you would say!
TROY:  Of course you should to the honors program
GABRIELLA:  I’ve been thinking of trying to talk my mom into letting me stay in Albuquerque for another year. Take some classes here, go to Stanford when I’m ready.
TROY:  You just can’t put off something as amazing as Stanford!
GABRIELLA:  So, maybe I get to be a little crazy, everything about my life has been full-speed ahead. This is the first time I’ve ever even wanted it all to slow down……to a stop
TROY:  We’re going to graduate. That’s going to happen.
GABRIELLA:  Does everything feel that easy for you? Lucky you, I guess. I get it, it’s senior year. This is what happens. But you know what, Troy, my heart doesn’t know it’s in high school. Don’t say anything else. I’m way better at saying good-byes than you. I’ve had a lot of practice.
TROY:  Wait, why are you saying good-bye? You’ll be back for prom and graduation
GABRIELLA:  I meant good-night
MISS DARBUS:  With Miss Montez unavailable to us, the show must go on. Sharpay, you’ll do Gabriella’s duet with Troy, Tiara, are you ready to step in for Sharpay?
TIARA:  Those shoes are impossible to fill, Miss Darbus.
MISS DARBUS:  Kelsi will work with you. All right, let’s get going. Where’s Troy?
COACH BOLTON:  How’s the big show going?
TROY:  You don’t want to know
COACH BOLTON:  If I’m honest, I’m glad you’re getting tired of it. I mean, when did you plan to tell me about this Juilliard thing?
TROY:  Nothing to tell
COACH BOLTON:  Well, maybe there is, I’m hearing you’re thinking about other schools
TROY:  U of A isn’t the only school that has talked to me, Dad. You know that
COACH BOLTON:  But it’s the only school we’ve talked about. Hey, Chad would be pretty disappointed if you changed your mind, for one thing
TROY:  He’d get over it. Would you?
COACH BOLTON:  We’ve been going to U of A games since you were a little kid. All you ever talked about is being in a Redhawk uniform.
TROY:  Only thing is, I’m not a little kid anymore. You raised me to make my own choices. I’m the one who needs to make them, not you or Chad or anyone else
COACH BOLTON:  Hey, Troy……
TROY:  Um……I know I’m not supposed to be here, Ms. Darbus……
MISS DARBUS:  Nor am I, but I’m trying to rebalance a show which Sharpay is now playing Miss Montez. And the reason for you visit is……?
TROY:  I guess I feel like this is a really good place to……
MISS DARBUS:  Scream? Feel free
TROY:  Or just to think
MISS DARBUS:  The stage is a wonderful partner in the process of self-discovery. You seen very comfortable up there
TROY:  I do?
MISS DARBUS:  Yes. Which is why I submitted an application in your name to Juilliard
TROY:  It was you?
MISS DARBUS:  Better to consider these opportunities now, than in ten years when life might limit your choices. If I’ve overstepped, I apologize
TROY:  I’m not mad……just confused
MISS DARBUS:  What I’ve learned from the stage is to trust one’s instincts. And that takes courage, a quality you don’t seem to lack. Stay as long as you like. Last one out turns off the lights.
GABRIELLA:  Well, this is it!
TROY:  Hey, I’m sorry I’ve been messing up your songs a little
KELSI:  It’s all of us! And all of us pretty much know why. If it wasn’t for Gabriella, our last musical would just be the Sharpay show
MRS. BOLTON:  Wow, gorgeous!
TROY:  I’d like to take credit, but Gabriella picked it out
MRS. BOLTON:  And I’ve ordered a corsage that’s going to perfectly match her dress
TROY:  Don’t even say that! Gabriella, the prom is in two days. You’re supposed to be on an airplane
GABRIELLA:  It’s taken me two weeks to get used to being away from you, from East High, and from all my friends. So I come back and go to the prom and I leave again? And then it’s graduation, and I leave again? I don’t think I can do it. I think I’ve run out of goodbyes, Troy. I really have. I need to stay right where I am. I’m sorry
TROY:  She’s not coming back
CHAD:  What? And miss prom?
CHAD:  Whoa. Hey, that’s lousy, man. It really is. School ends, and you don’t take the girl with you, right? Gabriella is one step ahead, as usual, but now, you snap out of it, dude. We’re all starting over. She’s at Stanford, Taylor’s heading to Yale. We’re at U of A. Whole new ball game
TROY:  Maybe I don’t see my life as a ‘ball game’ anymore, okay?
TROY:  Figured you’d be the last one out of the building
GABRIELLA:  I don’t believe this!
TROY:  I took a wrong turn on the way to my prom, and so did you
GABRIELLA:  You’re so crazy. What is it about you and trees?
TROY:  I see things clearly from up here
GABRIELLA:  You look handsome, but prom is……tonight. In Albuquerque, and that’s a thousand miles away
TROY:  My prom is wherever you are, and if I’m going to have a last dance at East High, it’s going to be with you
GABRIELLA:  It’s the best prom I could have imagined, Troy
TROY:  Well, if I learned to waltz, it’s all your fault, but it’s not just me who change when you came to East High, kids I used to just pass in the hallway, now we’re all friends. And we’re all supposed to do a show together. East High changed when you got there, and now it’s changed because you left. You may be ready to say good-bye to East High, but East High isn’t ready to say good-bye to you.
JIMMIE:  We haven’t officially met, even though I feel we know each other on a……sort of vibey level. I’m Jimmie ‘the Rocket’ Zara, and……
SHARPAY:  Jimmie the Rocket? What are you some sort of Muppet gangster.
SHARPAY:  Is that your cologne or a toxic spill?
JIMMIE:  I bought it for the show. It’s called Babe Magnet
SHARPAY:  Get out of my way! Send Troy in to see me; we need to run the song!
JIMMIE:  Hey, it’s Troy. Troy Bolton is sending me a text. Checking in. ‘Been driving all night. I’ll try and get there for the second act. Break a leg’ Break a leg? I don’t get it
DONNY:  Dude, I think it’s showbiz for ‘you’re going on’
JIMMIE:  As Troy? Onstage?
DONNY:  That so rocks!
MISS DARBUS:  No Troy? Donny, get word to Kelsi.
DONNY:  Ms. Darbus, I think he stopped breathing!
MISS DARBUS:  Get him some oxygen! It’s showtime!
MISS DARBUS:  Welcome students, family, friends, and faculty of East High, to our spring musical. This musical is dedicated to our graduating class of seniors that have worked very hard on this project. The musical is about themselves and how they reflect on their final days at East High. So, without further a do, Senior Year!
SHARPAY:  Perfect! Go for it. Save the day. Whoopee!
SHARPAY:  That’s my dress!
TIARA:  Had one made just like it. Only better! I’m playing Sharpay, remember? Do you mind stepping aside? I need to warm up and give a good first impression, since it will be my drama department next year
SHARPAY:  You’re not a singer; you’re a London school-girl!
TIARA:  Yes……London Academy of Dramatic Arts. I took the job with you to learn the theater ropes at East High. Now I have
SHARPAY:  But you were so……humble!
TIARA:  That’s called acting. You should try it sometime!
SHARPAY:  If East High is going to remember one Sharpay……it’s going to be me!
MISS DARBUS:  Ladies and gentlemen, our seniors! Martha Cox. University of Southern California. Dance
MISS DARBUS:  Zeke Baylor. Teen Chef of the Year, Cornell University. Culinary.
MISS DARBUS:  Kelsi Nielsen. The Juilliard School. Music
MISS DARBUS:  Jason Cross. You did it. You graduated.
MISS DARBUS:  Taylor McKessie. Yale University. Magna Cum Laude. Political Science
MISS DARBUS:  I’m pleased to announce that due to the excellence displayed here this evening, Juilliard has made an extraordinary decision. Another senior is now offered a Juilliard scholarship……Congratulations, Mr. Ryan Evans. Choreography
MISS DARBUS:  And as I will be taking a sabbatical next fall, I can now reveal with great pride my choice to run East High’s Drama Department during my absence. Congratulations and thank you……Miss Sharpay Evans.
MISS DARBUS:  And now, a senior who, I believe, has a decision to make. Mr. Troy Bolton. Troy?
TROY:  And I’ve chosen basketball, but I’ve also chosen theater. The University of California in Berkeley offers me both. And that’s where I’ll be going next fall. Most of all, I choose the person who inspires my heart, which is why I picked a school that’s exactly 32.7 miles from……you. Gabriella Montez. Stanford University. School of Law
MISS DARBUS:  Next, Mr. Chad Danforth, University of Albuquerque, Basketball scholarship
TAYLOR:  He’s gone!
CHAD:  So I guess when they hand us the diploma, we’re actually done here
TROY:  What makes you think we’re getting diplomas?
CHAD:  One question. Does Berkeley play……
TROY:  Yep, we’re scheduled to kick the Redhawks’ butts next November
CHAD:  Game on, hoops!
COACH BOLTON:  Danforth! Bolton! Get out there and get onstage
TROY:  Now there’s something I never thought I’d hear my dad say!
TROY:  East High is a place where teachers encouraged us to break the status quo and define ourselves as we choose. Where a jock can cook up a mean crème brulee, and a brainiac can break it down on the dance floor. It’s a place where one person, if it’s the right person……changes us all. East High is having friends we’ll keep for the rest of our lives. And that means we really are……all in this together. Once a Wildcat, always a Wildcat!
JIMMIE:  They left us their lucky socks!
DONNY:  Still haven’t been washed
JIMMIE:  Wow! Those dudes are so cool.
DONNY:  What team?
JIMMIE:  Wildcats!!!
DONNY:  What team?
JIMMIE:  Wildcats!
DONNY:  What team?
JIMMIE AND THE TEAM::  Wildcats! Get’cha head in the game!
THE END!!!:
