JACK'S MOTHER: What in heaven's name are you doing with the cow inside the house?
JACK: I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk.
JACK'S MOTHER: It's a she! How many times must I tell you? Only shes can give milk!

WIFE: Now, don't stray and be late!
BAKER: And you might save some of those sweets for Granny.
9:
LRRH: INTO THE WOODS AND DOWN THE DELL,/ THE PATH IS STRAIGHT, I KNOW IT WELL./ INTO THE WOODS, AND WHO CAN TELL/ WHAT'S WAITING ON THE JOURNEY?/ INTO THE WOODS TO BRING SOME BREAD/ TO GRANNY WHO IS SICK IN BED./ NEVER CAN TELL WHAT LIES AHEAD,/ FOR ALL THAT I KNOW, SHE'S ALREADY DEAD.

BAKER: Who might that be?
WIFE: We've sold our last loaf of bread!

WIFE: We have no bread.
WITCH: I don't want your bread.
BAKER: Then what is it you wish?
WITCH: It's not what I wish. It's what you wish.
WITCH (CONT'D): Nothing cooking in that belly now, is there? And there will never be
WITCH (CONT'D): Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days' time, a Blue Moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone.
WIFE: What curse?
WITCH: The one I placed on this house!
BAKER: What are you talking about?
WITCH: In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was-- GREENS, GREENS, AND NOTHING BUT GREENS:/ PARSLEY, PEPPERS, CABBAGES AND CELERY./ ASPARAGUS AND WATERCRESS AND/ FIDDLEFERNS AND LETTUCE--!/ HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT,"/ BUT IT WASN'T, QUITE,/ `CAUSE I CAUGHT HIM/ IN THE AUTUMN/ IN MY GARDEN ONE NIGHT!
WITCH'S POV:
WITCH (V.O.): HE WAS ROBBING ME,/ RAPING ME,/ ROOTING THROUGH MY RUTABAGA,/ RAIDING
MY ARUGULA:
WITCH: AND/ RIPPING UP THE RAMPION/ (MY CHAMPION!/ MY FAVORITE!) I SHOULD HAVE LAID A SPELL ON HIM RIGHT THERE--/ I COULD HAVE TURNED HIM INTO STONE/ OR A DOG OR A CHAIR/ BUT I LET HIM HAVE THE RAMPION/ I'D LOTS TO SPARE.
WITCH (V.O.): IN RETURN, HOWEVER,/ I SAID, "FAIR IS FAIR:/ YOU CAN LET ME HAVE THE BABY/ THAT YOUR WIFE WILL BEAR,
WITCH: AND WE'LL CALL IT SQUARE."
BAKER: I had a brother?
WITCH: No. But you had a sister.
BAKER: Where is she?
WITCH: She's mine now and you'll never find her! Small price to pay for what else your father stole from me. It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them.
WIFE: Lost what?
WITCH: The beans!
BAKER/WIFE: Beans?
WITCH: THE SPECIAL BEANS!
WITCH (V.O.): I LET HIM GO,/ I DIDN'T KNOW/ HE'D STOLEN MY BEANS!
WITCH (V.O.): I WAS WATCHING HIM CRAWL/ BACK OVER THE WALL,/ WHEN BANG! CRASH!/ THE LIGHTNING FLASH!/
WITCH: WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER STORY--/ NEVER MIND./ ANYWAY, AT LAST/ THE BIG DAY CAME/ AND I MADE MY CLAIM./ "OH, DON'T TAKE AWAY THE BABY,"/ THEY SHRIEKED AND SCREECHED,/
WITCH (V.O.): BUT I DID, AND I HID HER/ WHERE SHE'LL NEVER BE REACHED.
WITCH: AND YOUR FATHER CRIED/ AND YOUR MOTHER DIED,/ WHEN FOR EXTRA MEASURE--/ I ADMIT IT WAS A PLEASURE--/ I SAID, "SORRY, I'M STILL NOT MOLLIFIED."/ AND I LAID A LITTLE SPELL ON THEM--/ YOU TOO, SON--/ THAT YOUR FAMILY TREE/ WOULD ALWAYS BE/ A BARREN ONE
BAKER: How could you do that to me?
WITCH: And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be?
BAKER: I'm so sorry
WITCH: NOW THERE'S NO MORE FUSS/ AND THERE'S NO MORE SCENES/ AND MY GARDEN THRIVES -
/ YOU SHOULD SEE MY NECTARINES!/ BUT: I'M TELLING YOU THE SAME/ I TELL KINGS
AND QUEENS::
WITCH (CONT'D): DON'T EVER NEVER EVER/ MESS AROUND WITH MY GREENS!/ ESPECIALLY THE BEANS.
JACK: Why do I have to go to the next village?
JACK'S MOTHER: Because everyone in this village knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks.
JACK: But that's cheating.
JACK'S MOTHER: We're starving, Jack. Don't you understand that? You're not to take less than five pounds for her. Are you listening to me?
JACK: Yes.
JACK'S MOTHER: How much are you to ask?
JACK: No more than five pounds. JACK'S MOTHER JACK
JACK'S MOTHER: INTO THE WOODS, THE TIME IS NOW./ WE HAVE TO LIVE, I DON'T CARE HOW./ INTO THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW,/ YOU MUST BEGIN THE JOURNEY./ STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WOODS AND DON'T DELAY,/ WE HAVE TO FACE/ THE MARKETPLACE./ INTO THE WOODS TO JOURNEY'S END--
JACK: INTO THE WOODS TO SELL A FRIEND--
WITCH: YOU WISH TO HAVE THE CURSE REVERSED?
WITCH (CONT'D): I'LL NEED A CERTAIN POTION FIRST.
WITCH (CONT'D): GO TO THE WOOD AND BRING ME BACK/ ONE: THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ TWO: THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THREE: THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS CORN,/ FOUR: THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD./ BRING ME THESE BEFORE THE CHIME/ OF MIDNIGHT IN THREE DAYS' TIME,/ `TIS THEN THE BLUE MOON REAPPEARS,/ WHICH COMES BUT ONCE EACH HUNDRED YEARS./ BRING THEM AND I GUARANTEE,/ A CHILD AS PERFECT AS CHILD CAN BE. Go to the wood!
STEPMOTHER: Ladies. Our carriage awaits!
CINDERELLA: NOW MAY I GO TO THE FESTIVAL?
STEPMOTHER: The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!/ DARLING, THOSE CLOTHES!/ LENTILS ARE ONE THING, BUT/ DARLING, WITH THOSE,/ YOU'D MAKE US THE FOOLS OF THE FESTIVAL/ AND MORTIFY THE PRINCE!
CINDERELLA: The festival lasts three nights. Surely you can let me be there for one of them.
STEPMOTHER: The King is trying to find his son a wife -- not a scullery maid! We must be gone!
CINDERELLA: I WISH
WIFE: Here. Take this
BAKER: I'm not wearing that.
WIFE: Why?
BAKER: It was my father's. You heard what she said. This is all his fault.
BAKER (CONT'D): I want nothing to do with him!
WIFE: Look!
WIFE (CONT'D): Beans. The Witch's beans! We'll take them with us.
BAKER: We? Wait a minute! You're not coming. It's not safe out there.
WIFE: I can help you.
BAKER: No. I can do this on my own.
BAKER WIFE: ON OUR HOUSE.
BAKER (CONT'D): Now tell me. What am I to return with?
WIFE: You don't remember?! THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS CORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD.
BAKER: THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS CORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD
CINDERELLA: I STILL WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL,/ BUT HOW AM I EVER TO GET TO THE FESTIVAL?
BAKER: THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS CORN

BAKER (V.O.): Deep within the woods, Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her mother. And she visited there so often, and wept so much, that her tears watered it until it had become a magnificent tree.
CINDERELLA: I WISH
C'S MOTHER: What is it that you wish, child? C'S MOTHER (CONT'D) DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WISH?/ ARE YOU CERTAIN WHAT YOU WISH/ IS WHAT YOU WANT?/ IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,/ THEN MAKE A WISH--/ ASK THE TREE,/ AND YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH.

LRRH: To my Grandmother's.
WOLF: And what might be in your basket?
LRRH: It's bread for Grandmother so she'll have something good to make her strong.

BAKER: You frightened me!
WITCH: Get it! Get it! Get it!
BAKER: How am I supposed to get it?
WITCH: You go up to the little thing, and you take it.
BAKER: I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it!
WITCH: It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects!
WITCH (CONT'D): Get me what I need! Get me what I need!
BAKER: This is ridiculous!
BAKER (CONT'D): Hello there little girl.
LRRH: Hello, Mr. Baker.
BAKER: Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny?
LRRH: I ate all the sweets and half the loaf of bread.
BAKER: So I see! Now tell mewhere did you get that beautiful cape?
LRRH: My Granny made it for me.

LRRH: You'd look pretty foolish.
BAKER: May I take a look at it?
LRRH: No!
BAKER: I need it badly.
LRRH: Please -- give it back!
BAKER: I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way.
LRRH: I would rather a wolf than you any day.
BAKER: This is hopeless. I'll never get that red cape or find a golden cow and a yellow slipper -- or was it a golden slipper and a yellow cow?
WIFE (O.S.): THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS CORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS--

WIFE: What are you planning to do there?
BAKER: And what are you planning to do there?
JACK: Sell my cow, sir. No less than five pounds.
BAKER: Five pounds! Where are we to get five pounds?
WIFE: She must be generous of milk to fetch five pounds?
JACK: Yes, ma'am.
WIFE: And if you can't fetch that sum? Then what are you to do?
JACK: I hadn't thought of that
BAKER: This is all we have
WIFE: (loudly, for the benefit of the boy) Beans? We mustn't give up our beans! Well, if you feel we must

BAKER: Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit?
WIFE: No one would have given him more for this creature. We did him a favor. At least they'll have some food.
BAKER: Five beans?!
WIFE: Do we want a child or not?
BAKER: Of course. But
WIFE: We have one chance. Don't you see that? And if we fail
BAKER: I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father.
WIFE: Why do you say that?
BAKER: Because of my father.
WIFE: You're not him.
BAKER: I don't know
WIFE: If you can't do this for yourself, can't you at least do it for me?
BAKER: All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own.

AND YOUR HEART IS LEAD AND YOUR STOMACH STONE/ AND YOU'RE REALLY SCARED BEING ALL ALONE,/ AND IT'S THEN THAT YOU MISS ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE KNOWN/ AND THE WORLD YOU'VE LEFT AND THE LITTLE YOU OWN.
JACK (V.O.): THE FUN IS DONE./ YOU STEAL WHAT YOU CAN AND RUN! JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D) AND YOU SCRAMBLE DOWN/ AND YOU LOOK BELOW,/ AND THE WORLD YOU KNOW/ BEGINS
TO GROW::
JACK: THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND YOUR MOTHER AT THE DOOR./ THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND THE WORLD YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO EXPLORE./ AND YOU THINK OF ALL OF THE THINGS YOU'VE SEEN./ AND YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD LIVE IN BETWEEN,/
JACK (CONT'D): AND YOU'RE BACK AGAIN,/ ONLY DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE,/ AFTER THE SKY. THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!/ THERE ARE BIG TALL TERRIBLE AWESOME SCARY/ WONDERFUL GIANTS IN THE SKY!
JACK (CONT'D): So, here's your money, sir! Five gold pieces. Where is my Milky-White?
BAKER: Milky-White is back home with my wife.
JACK: Let's go find them!
BAKER: Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell.
JACK: But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money?
BAKER: No, no, no! It's not that--
JACK: You keep that. I'll fetch some more.
BAKER: Wait. I didn't say--
BAKER (CONT'D): Hey, come back!
BAKER: What are you doing here?
WIFE: Well
WIFE (CONT'D): I see you've got the red cape!
BAKER: Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left.
WIFE: Three.
BAKER: Two. We've the cape and the cow.
WIFE: You've the cape
BAKER: What have you done with the cow?!
WIFE: She ran away. I never reached home. I've been looking for her all night.
BAKER: How could you?
WIFE: She might just as easily have run from you!
BAKER: But she didn't!
WIFE: BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
BAKER: BUT SHE DIDN'T!!!
WITCH (O.S.): WHO CARES!
WITCH (CONT'D): THE COW IS GONE! GET IT BACK! GET IT BACK!!!
BAKER: We were just going to do that. Here.
BAKER (CONT'D): You can have this--
WITCH: DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH THAT, FOOL!! I can't touch it! By midnight tomorrow bring me the items or that child you wish for will never see the light of day!
BAKER: I don't like that woman.
WIFE: I'm sorry I lost the cow.
BAKER: I shouldn't have yelled. Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls.
BAKER (CONT'D): GO!, please -- go.
R'S PRINCE: Good brother. I was wondering where you'd gone.
C'S PRINCE: I have been looking all night for her.
R'S PRINCE: Her?
C'S PRINCE: The beautiful one I danced the evening with.
R'S PRINCE: Where did she go?
C'S PRINCE: Disappeared, like the fine morning mist.
R'S PRINCE: She was lovely?
C'S PRINCE: The loveliest.
R'S PRINCE: I am not certain of that! I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden. She lives here in the woods.
C'S PRINCE: The woods?
R'S PRINCE: Yes! In the top of a tall tower that has no door or stairs.
C'S PRINCE: Where?
R'S PRINCE: Two leagues from here, due east, just beyond the mossy knoll near the rose thickets.
C'S PRINCE: And how do you manage a visit?
R'S PRINCE: I stand beneath her tower and say, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me." And then she lowers the longest, most beautiful head of hair - yellow as corn - which I climb.
C'S PRINCE: Rapunzel, Rapunzel! What kind of name is that? You jest! I have never heard of such a thing.
R'S PRINCE: I speak the truth! She is as true as your maiden. A maiden running from a prince? None would run from us.
C'S PRINCE: Yet one has. C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) DID I ABUSE HER/ OR SHOW HER DISDAIN?/ WHY DOES SHE RUN FROM ME?/ IF I SHOULD LOSE HER,/ HOW SHALL I REGAIN/ THE HEART SHE HAS WON FROM ME? AGONY--!/ BEYOND POWER OF SPEECH./ WHEN THE ONE THING YOU WANT/ IS THE ONLY THING OUT OF YOUR REACH.
R'S PRINCE: HIGH IN HER TOWER,/ SHE SITS BY THE HOUR,/ MAINTAINING HER HAIR./ BLITHE AND BECOMING,/ AND FREQUENTLY HUMMING/ A LIGHTHEARTED AIR:/ "AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-
AHAH--": AGONY--!/ FAR MORE PAINFUL THAN YOURS,/ WHEN YOU KNOW SHE WOULD GO WITH YOU,/ IF THERE ONLY WERE DOORS.
BOTH: AGONY!/ OH THE TORTURE THEY TEACH!
R'S PRINCE: WHAT'S AS INTRIGUING--
C'S PRINCE: OR HALF SO FATIGUING--
BOTH: AS WHAT'S OUT OF REACH?
C'S PRINCE: AM I NOT SENSITIVE, CLEVER,/ WELL- MANNERED, CONSIDERATE,/ PASSIONATE, CHARMING,/ AS KIND AS I'M HANDSOME,/ AND HEIR TO A THRONE?
R'S PRINCE: YOU ARE EVERYTHING MAIDENS COULD WISH FOR!
C'S PRINCE: THEN WHY NO--?
R'S PRINCE: DO I KNOW?
C'S PRINCE: THE GIRL MUST BE MAD.
R'S PRINCE: YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MADNESS/ TILL YOU'RE CLIMBING HER HAIR/ AND YOU SEE HER UP THERE/ AS YOU'RE NEARING HER,/ ALL THE WHILE HEARING HER,/ "AH-AH-AH-
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH--":
BOTH: AGONY!
C'S PRINCE: MISERY!
R'S PRINCE: WOE!
BOTH: THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EACH.
C'S PRINCE: ALWAYS TEN STEPS BEHIND--
R'S PRINCE: ALWAYS TEN FEET BELOW--
BOTH: AND SHE'S JUST OUT OF REACH./ AGONY/ THAT CAN CUT LIKE A KNIFE! I MUST HAVE HER TO WIFE.
WIFE: Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me.
RAPUNZEL: Is that you at this hour, my Prince?
WIFE: (in her best princely
BASS VOICE): Yes.
WIFE (CONT'D): Excuse me for this.
BAKER (V.O.): As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince.
C'S PRINCE (O.S.): Over here! C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) Who is she? Where did she go?
WIFE: I have no idea, sir.
C'S PRINCE: Don't play the fool, woman!
WIFE: I was trying to hold her here for you
C'S PRINCE: I can capture my own damsel, thank you.
WIFE: Yes, of course.
STEWARD: No sign of her, my liege.
C'S PRINCE: Well, what are you waiting for? See if you can find her. C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) The woods can be a dangerous place
BAKER: Moo Moo
BAKER'S POV:
ANOTHER ANGLE:
BAKER (CONT'D): Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? LUCINDA AND FLORINDA Don't touch us! Get away! How dare you!
STEPMOTHER: Mongrel! Carry on!
BAKER: Milky-White!
BAKER (CONT'D): I thought you were returning home!
WIFE: Oh! It's you! And you've the cow!
BAKER: Yes. I've the cow. We've two of the four.
WIFE: Three.
BAKER: Two.
WIFE: Three!
WIFE (CONT'D): Compare this to your corn.
BAKER: Where did you find it?
WIFE: I pulled it from a maiden in a tower.
BAKER: Three!
WIFE: And I almost had the fourth, but she got away.
BAKER: We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then.
WIFE: We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you?
BAKER: Wellperhaps it will take the two of us to have this child.
WIFE: YOU'VE CHANGED./ YOU'RE DARING./ YOU'RE DIFFERENT IN THE WOODS./ MORE SURE,/ MORE SHARING./ YOU'RE GETTING US THROUGH THE WOODS. IF YOU COULD SEE--/ YOU'RE NOT THE MAN WHO STARTED,/ AND MUCH MORE OPEN- HEARTED/ THEN I KNEW/ YOU TO BE.
BAKER: IT TAKES TWO./ I THOUGHT ONE WAS ENOUGH,/ IT'S NOT TRUE:/ IT TAKES TWO OF US./ YOU CAME THROUGH/ WHEN THE JOURNEY WAS ROUGH--/ IT TOOK YOU./ IT TOOK TWO OF US. IT TAKES CARE,/ IT TAKES PATIENCE AND FEAR AND DESPAIR/ TO CHANGE./ THOUGH YOU SWEAR/ TO CHANGE,/ WHO CAN TELL IF YOU DO?/ IT TAKES TWO.
WIFE: YOU'VE CHANGED./ YOU'RE THRIVING./ THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOODS./ NOT JUST/ SURVIVING,/ YOU'RE BLOSSOMING IN THE WOODS. AT HOME I'D FEAR/ WE'D STAY THE SAME FOREVER./ AND THEN OUT HERE/ YOU'RE PASSIONATE, CHARMING, CONSIDERATE,
CLEVER--:
BAKER: IT TAKES ONE/ TO BEGIN, BUT THEN ONCE/ YOU'VE BEGUN,/ IT TAKES TWO OF YOU./ IT'S NO FUN,/ BUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE/ YOU CAN DO/ WHEN THERE'S TWO OF YOU. IF I DARE,/ IT'S BECAUSE I'M BECOMING/ AWARE/ OF US/ AS A PAIR/ OF US,/ EACH ACCEPTING A SHARE/ OF WHAT'S THERE.
BOTH: WE'VE CHANGED./ WE'RE STRANGERS./ I'M MEETING YOU IN THE WOODS./ WHO MINDS/ WHAT DANGERS?/ I KNOW WE'LL GET PAST THE WOODS. AND ONCE WE'RE PAST,/ LET'S HOPE THE CHANGES LAST/ BEYOND WOODS,/ BEYOND WITCHES AND SLIPPERS AND HOODS,/ JUST THE TWO OF US--/ BEYOND LIES,/ SAFE AT HOME WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL PRIZE,/ JUST THE FEW OF US. IT TAKES TRUST./ IT TAKES JUST/ A BIT MORE AND WE'RE DONE./
BOTH (CONT'D): WE WANT FOUR,/WE HAD NONE./ WE'VE GOT THREE./ WE NEED ONE./ IT TAKES TWO.
JACK (O.S.): Stop it! Stop my egg!
JACK (CONT'D): Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg!
BAKER: Where did you get this?
JACK: From the Giant's hen!
WIFE: A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg.
JACK: And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces.
WIFE: Five gold pieces?
JACK: Now I'm taking my cow.
BAKER JACK:
WIFE BAKER:
WIFE: Where are the five gold pieces?
JACK: You said I could have my cow!
BAKER WIFE:
BAKER: No, no, no - it's not how it sounds!
JACK: Milky-White!
JACK (CONT'D): Milky-White is dead!
WITCH(O.S.): TWO MIDNIGHTS GONE!
BAKER (V.O.): When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower.
WITCH: WHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY?/ CHILDREN MUST LISTEN.
RAPUNZEL: No, no, please!
WITCH: WHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?/ CHILDREN
MUST SEE--:
RAPUNZEL: No!
WITCH: AND LEARN./ WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?/ CHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN./ WHAT HAVE I BEEN TO YOU?/ WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME BE,/ HANDSOME LIKE A PRINCE? AH, BUT I AM OLD./ I AM UGLY./ I EMBARRASS YOU.
RAPUNZEL: No!
WITCH: YOU ARE ASHAMED OF ME.
RAPUNZEL: No!
WITCH: YOU ARE ASHAMED./ YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
RAPUNZEL: I'm no longer a child. I wish to see the world.
WITCH: DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD?/ SOMEONE HAS TO SHIELD YOU FROM THE WORLD./ STAY WITH ME. PRINCES WAIT THERE IN THE WORLD, IT'S TRUE./ PRINCES, YES, BUT WOLVES AND HUMANS, TOO./ STAY AT HOME./ I AM HOME./ WHO OUT THERE COULD LOVE YOU MORE THAN I?/ WHAT OUT THERE THAT I CANNOT SUPPLY?/ STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME,/ THE WORLD IS DARK AND WILD./ STAY A CHILD WHILE YOU CAN BE A CHILD./ WITH ME.
WITCH (CONT'D): I gave you protection and yet you disobeyed me.
RAPUNZEL: No!
WITCH: Your prince will never lay eyes on you again. He will never lay eyes on anything again!
RAPUNZEL: What did you do to him?
WITCH: It doesn't matter because where you're going, no one will ever see you again.
JACK: Hey there - nice cape!
LRRH: Stay away from my cape or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!
JACK: Whoa! I don't want it. Where did you get it?
LRRH: My Granny made it for me from a wolf that attacked us. And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.
JACK: Well, look what I have! A golden egg.
LRRH: Where did you get that egg?
JACK: I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant.
LRRH: I don't believe you.
JACK: It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it.
LRRH: Of course it does. Why don't you go up to the kingdom right now and bring it back and show me?
JACK: I could.
LRRH: You could not!
JACK: I could!
LRRH: You could not, Mr. Liar!
JACK: I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see!
BAKER (V.O.): Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant.
BAKER: We've only one day left! I don't know where to start.
WIFE: You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy.
BAKER: Right, where do I buy a cow?
WIFE: You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there.
BAKER: What are you going to do?
WIFE: I'm going to get the slipper.
BAKER: The yellow slipper?
WIFE: The GOLDEN slipper!
BAKER: Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it?
WIFE: I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights.
BAKER: You think you could get one?
WIFE: Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here.
BAKER: Right. Why are we always separating?
WIFE: Because we have to if we're going to be together
WIFE (CONT'D): What is happening?
BAKER (V.O.): The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant
BAKER (V.O.): as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince again.
CINDERELLA: HE'S A VERY SMART PRINCE,/ HE'S A PRINCE WHO PREPARES./ KNOWING THIS TIME I'D RUN FROM HIM,/ HE SPREAD PITCH ON THE STAIRS./ AND I'M CAUGHT UNAWARES./ WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE CARES--/ THIS IS MORE THAN JUST MALICE./ BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK/ WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE STUCK/ ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE. ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?/ HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION./ WHY NOT STAY AND BE CAUGHT?/ SHOULD I GIVE THAT A THOUGHT,/ WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?/
CINDERELLA (CONT'D): BUT THEN WHAT IF HE KNEW/ WHO I AM WHEN I KNOW/ THAT I'M NOT WHAT HE THINKS/ THAT HE WANTS? OR THEN WHAT IF I AM/ WHAT A PRINCE WOULD ENVISION?/ BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU KNOW/ WHO YOU ARE TILL YOU KNOW/ WHAT YOU WANT, WHICH I DON'T?/ SO THEN WHICH DO YOU PICK:/ WHERE YOU'RE SAFE, OUT OF SIGHT,/ AND YOURSELF, BUT WHERE EVERYTHING'S WRONG?/ OR WHERE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT/ BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'LL NEVER BELONG? AND WHICHEVER YOU PICK,/ DO IT QUICK,/ `CAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TO STICK/ TO THE STEPS OF THE PALACE. IT'S MY FIRST BIG DECISION,/ THE CHOICE ISN'T EASY TO MAKE./ TO ARRIVE AT A BALL/ IS EXCITING AND ALL--/ ONCE YOU'RE THERE, THOUGH, IT'S SCARY. AND IT'S FUN TO DECEIVE/ WHEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN LEAVE,/ BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARY. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S AT STAKE,/ BUT I'VE STALLED LONG ENOUGH,/ `CAUSE I'M STILL STANDING STUCK/ IN THE STUFF ON THESE STEPS BETTER RUN ALONG HOME/ AND AVOID THE COLLISION./ THOUGH AT HOME THEY DON'T CARE,/ I'LL BE BETTER OFF THERE/ WHERE THERE'S NOTHING TO CHOOSE,/ SO THERE'S NOTHING TO LOSE./ SO I'LL PRY UP MY SHOES.
CINDERELLA (CONT'D): WAIT, THOUGH, THINKING IT THROUGH,/ THINGS DON'T HAVE TO COLLIDE--/ I KNOW WHAT MY DECISION IS:/ WHICH IS NOT TO DECIDE./I'LL JUST LEAVE HIM A CLUE:/ FOR EXAMPLE, A SHOE./ AND THEN SEE WHAT HE'LL DO.
CINDERELLA (CONT'D): NOW IT'S HE AND NOT YOU/ WHO'LL BE STUCK WITH A SHOE,/ IN A STEW,/ IN THE GOO,/ AND I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING, TOO,/ SOMETHING I NEVER KNEW,/ ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE!
C'S PRINCE: The ball is over. Send everyone home.
STEWARD: And the Princess?
C'S PRINCE: She won't get far with one shoe.
CINDERELLA: Don't come any closer to me!
WIFE: Please, stop! Just hear me out!
CINDERELLA: You have attacked me once before.
WIFE: I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean in exchange for it.
CINDERELLA: Magic bean? Nonsense!
WIFE: Wait, please. I haven't much time! I need that shoe to have a child.
CINDERELLA: That makes no sense!
WIFE: Does it make sense that you're running from a prince?
STEWARD (O.S.): Stop! You there, stop!
CINDERELLA: I must go!
WIFE: (starts to take off a
SHOE): Take my shoes. You'll run faster.
CINDERELLA:
HERE--:
WIFE: Thank you! Thank you!
STEWARD: Stop! What is that you have in your hand?
WIFE: It's mine.
STEWARD: Lying will cost you your life!
WIFE: I don't care if this costs me my life
STEWARD: You will pay for this!
STEWARD (CONT'D): Sire! I have succeeded in obtaining the other slipper.
WIFE: Please give me the slipper, kind Prince, and all will come to a happy end.
STEWARD: Step back, peon!
C'S PRINCE: Do as she says, Steward. We only need one.
STEWARD: Oh
WIFE: Thank you. Thank you!
C'S PRINCE: We must search immediately for the maiden who fits this slipper.
STEWARD: Tonight?
C'S PRINCE: This very night!
BAKER (V.O.): And in her haste, the Baker's Wife took no notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.
STEWARD: Let it be known that his Royal Highness the Crown Prince will be visiting every house in this village tonight.
STEWARD (O.S.): All young maidens are hereby commanded to remain in their home until they are visited by the Royal Guard.
BAKER (V.O.): As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands.
FLORINDA: CAREFUL, MY TOE--!
STEPMOTHER: DARLING, I KNOW--
FLORINDA: WHAT'LL WE DO?
STEPMOTHER: IT'LL HAVE TO GO./ BUT WHEN YOU'RE HIS BRIDE,/ YOU CAN SIT OR RIDE./ YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO WALK!
BAKER (V.O.): Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper.
BAKER (V.O.): Lucinda was next.
LUCINDA: WHY WON'T IT FIT?
STEPMOTHER: DARLING, BE STILL./ CUT OFF A BIT/ OF THE HEEL AND IT WILL./ AND WHEN YOU'RE HIS WIFE/ YOU'LL HAVE SUCH A LIFE,/ YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO WALK!
QUICK SHOTS::
BAKER (V.O.): Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain.
STEPMOTHER: It's a perfect fit, Your Highness!
C'S PRINCE: Have you no other daughters?
STEPMOTHER: Only a little stunted kitchen wench, which her late father left behind but she cannot present herself. She is too dirty.
C'S PRINCE: I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere. This is the true bride!
BAKER (V.O.): As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters and blinded them.
BAKER (V.O.): As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest.
R'S PRINCE: Rapunzel? Rapunzel?
RAPUNZEL: My darling!
R'S PRINCE: Rapunzel? Is it you?
RAPUNZEL: How could she do this to you?
R'S PRINCE: Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL: What?
R'S PRINCE: I can see you!
BAKER: Come on! We don't have any time
WIFE: I've found you! You've got the cow!
BAKER: You've got the slipper!
WIFE: We've all four!
WITCH: I see a cow. I see a slipper.
BAKER: And the cape as red as blood.
WIFE: And the hair as yellow as corn.
BAKER: We've done it!
WIFE: We've got them all.
WITCH: Wait a minute! That cow doesn't look as white as milk to me.
WIFE: Of course she is.
WIFE (CONT'D): She has to be!
WITCH: This cow has been covered with flour!
WIFE: What? You didn't get a real white cow?
BAKER: We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did.
WITCH: Then where is she?
WIFE: She's dead.
BAKER: And we thought you'd prefer a live cow.
WITCH: Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So show me the dead cow and I'll bring her back to life!
JACK'S MOTHER: Jack! There you are! I've been worried sick about you! There's a dead giant in our backyard!
JACK: There is?
JACK'S MOTHER: You know there is. You could have been crushed!
JACK: But Mother, look. The most beautiful harp.
JACK'S MOTHER: You've stolen too much. JACK'S MOTHER (CONT'D) You could have been killed coming down that plant.
WIFE: We're running out of time!
BAKER: It's here
JACK: What's happening?
BAKER: She's going to bring Milky-White back to life.
JACK: She can do that?
BAKER: She's a witch! She can do anything!
JACK: Wow!
WITCH: Stand back!
JACK: Milky-White. You're back! I missed you so much!
BAKER: It's almost midnight!
WITCH: Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.
WIFE: What?
WITCH: You heard me! Feed them to the cow!
WITCH (CONT'D): Fill this!
JACK: I'll do it. She'll only milk for me.
JACK (CONT'D): Squeeze, pal! You can do it.
WITCH: Wrong ingredients. Forget about a child!
WIFE: Wait! We followed your instructions. One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?
WITCH: Yes.
WIFE: And two, the cape was certainly as red as blood.
WITCH: Yes.
WIFE: And three, the slipper--
WITCH: Yes.
BAKER: And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn.
WIFE: I pulled it from a maiden in a tower
AND--:
WITCH: You what?! What were you doing there?
WIFE: Well, nothing. I happened to be
PASSING BY--:
WITCH: I touched that hair! I told you! I cannot have touched the ingredients!
BAKER/WIFE: Nooooo
JACK: The corn! The corn!
BAKER: What?
JACK: You can use the silky hair of the corn--
WITCH: Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly!
WIFE: It's working!
JACK: She's milking!
WITCH: At last!
BAKER: That was quick!
CUT TO::
BAKER (V.O.): And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince.
BAKER (V.O.): Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy.
BAKER (V.O.): And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy.
WIFE: Thanks for the slipper.
STEWARD: Let us cheer the newlyweds as they embark on their happy bliss today, and
EVER AFTER--:
BAKER (V.O.): And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever
JACK'S MOTHER: Jack? Jack?
BAKER: Are you alright?
WIFE: I think so.
BAKER: And the baby?
WIFE: Yes, he's fine.
STEWARD: (speaking into the
HORN): Attention! Attention! Let there be no panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince wishes to address his loyal subjects. Attention!
C'S PRINCE: There's no need for worry. It was an earthquake in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all. As many of you know, we had another little shaker just days ago. I will personally investigate the disturbance. Now everyone, back to your villages, and on with your lives!
BAKER (V.O.): But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn.
WIFE: What's happened? Everything's so different.
BAKER: Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase?
LRRH: I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. And now I can't find my Granny's cottage.
BAKER: What do you mean?
LRRH: I went down the dell, and I didn't recognize anything. There was no path. Where's the stream? Where's the bridge? Where's Granny?
WIFE: Calm down.
BAKER: We can help you find Granny's without the path.
WIFE: Yes.
WIFE (CONT'D): Please take him for a few moments.
BAKER: Why does he always cry when I hold him?
WIFE: You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile.
BAKER: He doesn't want me. He wants his mother!
WIFE: I can't take care of him all of the time.
BAKER: I'll take care of him -- when he's older
WIFE: Who might that be?
BAKER: It's the Steward and the royal family.
BAKER: What brings you into the woods?
STEWARD: The castle has been destroyed.
WIFE: No!
STEPMOTHER: The kingdom is under attack.
BAKER: What is the Royal family going to do?
STEWARD: I have no idea! I don't make policy. I just carry it out.
WIFE: I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us.
WIFE (CONT'D): You come with us.
WIFE (CONT'D): It's a giant!
BAKER: A giant woman!
GIANT: Where is the lad who killed my husband?
STEWARD: There is no lad here!
BAKER: We haven't seen him.
WITCH: We'll get him for you right away. Don't move!
LRRH: It was you who destroyed our house - not an earthquake.
GIANT: And who destroyed my house? I want him!
WITCH: Would you like a blind girl instead?
STEPMOTHER: How dare you? She wants the boy!
JACK'S MOTHER: Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran off again and I've been
STEWARD: She's looking for him too.
GIANT: Give him to me!
JACK'S MOTHER: Jack is just a lad! We had no food to eat so he sold his beloved cow in exchange for magic beans.
GIANT: The boy - I want the boy!
JACK'S MOTHER: You leave my boy alone!
GIANT: You're making me very angry!
GIANT (CONT'D): I'm waiting!
STEWARD: Don't make her angry, woman, or you'll get us all killed!
JACK'S MOTHER: Flouncing through our kingdom with your great big clodhopppers, destroying everything in your path.
STEWARD: Stop!
BAKER: Don't upset the Giant!
JACK'S MOTHER: You big bully! I'll hide my son and you'll never find him. You'll never, ever
STEWARD: Get back woman!
STEWARD (CONT'D): The boy is hiding in the steeple tower. You can find him there.
STEPMOTHER: Yes, that's true.
FLORINDA LUCINDA:
GIANT: If he is not, I will return tonight and find you! All of you!
WIFE: Look! What have you done to her?
STEWARD: I didn't mean to hurt her. I was just thinking of the greater good.
BAKER: Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together.
STEPMOTHER: Some people are cut out to battle giants, and others are not. I don't have the constitution. And as long as I can be of no help, I'm going to hide. Let's go! Everything will work out fine in the end.
WITCH: Not always.
WITCH (CONT'D): I don't know where they think they're going. The giant's already destroyed the entire village. Only thing left of my garden are these beans.
LRRH: What are we going to do now?
WITCH: We have no choice. Find the boy and give her what she wants.
LRRH: But if we do, she'll kill Jack.
WITCH: And if we don't she'll kill half the kingdom!
JACK'S MOTHER: Promise me you won't let them get Jack. Promise!
BAKER: Okay, I promise.
WITCH: Rapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness.
RAPUNZEL: Who are you?
WITCH: Surely you remember? Of course you don't recognize me!
RAPUNZEL: Mother?
WITCH: This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you don't have to be embarrassed by me. You must come with me. There's a Giant in the land.
R'S PRINCE: My darling. Are you all right? Why did you run off?
RAPUNZEL: I was afraid.
R-PRINCE: You never have to be afraid. Now come with me.
WITCH: She's not going with you! You will come with me.
RAPUNZEL: I will not come with you!
WITCH: Then you leave me no choice.
R'S PRINCE: You! The one who blinded me.
RAPUNZEL: And locked me in a tower.
WITCH: To protect you.
RAPUNZEL: and then banished me to an island -- in the middle of a swamp!
WITCH: I was just trying to be a good mother!
R'S PRINCE: Rapunzel
WITCH: Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him.
RAPUNZEL: Take me away from here.
WITCH: No! Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL: Don't you understand? I never want to see you again. Ever!
WITCH: NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,/ CHILDREN WON'T LISTEN./ NO MATTER WHAT YOU KNOW,/ CHILDREN REFUSE/ TO LEARN. GUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY,/ STILL THEY DON'T LISTEN./ CHILDREN CAN ONLY GROW/ FROM SOMETHING YOU LOVE/ TO SOMETHING YOU LOSE
BAKER (O.S.) BAKER'S WIFE (O.S.):
LRRH (O.S.): Jack!

JACK: Maybe I shouldn't have stolen from the Giant
LRRH: Maybe I shouldn't have strayed from the path
CINDERELLA: Maybe I shouldn't have attended the Ball
BAKER: Yes. Maybe you shouldn't have
JACK: Where are you going?
BAKER: Away from here.
LRRH: But you said we had to find our way out of this together.
BAKER: It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart.
JACK: We need your help.
BAKER: You don't understand. My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything.
CINDERELLA: You would leave your child?
BAKER: He'll be happier in the arms of a Princess
CINDERELLA: But wait
BAKER'S FATHER (O.S.): Son.
BAKER: What are you doing here?
BAKER (CONT'D): I don't want to talk to you. It's because of you all of this happened. Go away!
BAKER'S FATHER: I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.
BAKER: Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans?
BAKER'S FATHER: They were there and I wanted them. I didn't think. I was being careless --
BAKER: -- Selfish.
BAKER'S FATHER:
YES --:
BAKER: You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away.
BAKER'S FATHER: When your mother died, I was I hated myself and I ran from my guilt and my shame
BAKER:
and your son.:
BAKER'S FATHER: Yes, and my son. And I'm sorry for that.
BAKER: If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it.
BAKER'S FATHER: I never expected
BAKER: Then what do you want?
BAKER'S FATHER: Aren't you making the same mistake? BAKER'S FATHER (CONT'D) Aren't you running away? (the Baker looks
AWAY): Be better than me, son. Do better
JACK: If there were just some way we could surprise the Giant.
LRRH: She's too tall to surprise.
CINDERELLA: I knew you wouldn't give up.
JACK: He wouldn't leave his baby.
LRRH: It looked like he was going to.
BAKER: Give me my son.
BAKER (CONT'D): (pulling the baby close to comfort
HIM): Hey, hey.
LRRH: What are we going to do now?
BAKER: We need to rid this kingdom of the Giant -- together.
BAKER (CONT'D): She'll be back soon; here's the plan. We're going to feed Jack to the Giant.
JACK CINDERELLA:
BAKER (CONT'D): We're going to use you as bait to lure the Giant towards the tar pit.
CINDERELLA: The birds can help! Oh good friends we need your help more than ever. What of the prince?
CINDERELLA (CONT'D): That doesn't matter now! What's important is that we find a way to defeat the Giant. Oh yes, thank you birds.
LRRH: You can talk to birds?
CINDERELLA: The birds will do their part.
BAKER: Okay, we don't have much time.
JACK: I'm excited.
BAKER: Here's what we're going to do
CINDERELLA: Your father's being very brave. We're going to be very brave too.
C'S PRINCE: Are you alright, miss?
CINDERELLA: The Giant went in that direction.
C'S PRINCE: My darling! I did not recognize you. What are you doing here? And with a child? You must go back to the castle at once. There's a giant on the loose.
CINDERELLA: I'm well aware of that.
C'S PRINCE: My love. What is it?
CINDERELLA: Maybe I'm not your only love.
C'S PRINCE: I love you. Truly I do.
CINDERELLA: If you love me, why did you stray?
C'S PRINCE: I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more.
CINDERELLA: If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be?
C'S PRINCE: I was raised to be charming, not sincere.
CINDERELLA: I think you should go.
C'S PRINCE: I'm not going to leave you.
CINDERELLA: Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant.
C'S PRINCE: Is that what you really wish?
CINDERELLA: My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between.
C'S PRINCE: I shall always love the maiden who ran away.
CINDERELLA: And I the faraway prince.
CUT TO::
BAKER: Careful, there. Not so fast.
JACK: You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk.
LRRH: They're in the tree -- over there. We made slings out of my cape.
LRRH (CONT'D): I wanted to climb too.
CINDERELLA: I'm glad you're here to help me.
CINDERELLA (CONT'D): What's wrong?
LRRH: I think my mother and my Granny would be upset with me.
CINDERELLA: Why?
LRRH: They said always to make them proud and here I am about to kill somebody.
CINDERELLA: Not somebody. A giant who's done a lot of harm.
LRRH: But a giant's a person. Aren't we to show forgiveness?
CINDERELLA: MOTHER CANNOT GUIDE YOU./ NOW YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN./ ONLY ME BESIDE YOU./ STILL, YOU'RE NOT ALONE./ NO ONE IS ALONE, TRULY./ NO ONE IS ALONE.
LRRH: I WISH
CINDERELLA: I know.
JACK: Wait until my mother hears I've slain the Giant.
BAKER: Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother
JACK: What?
BAKER: She didn't make it.
JACK: Was she killed by the Giant?
BAKER: No. It wasn't like that. She was fighting with the Giant, trying to protect you, and she was pushed by the Steward -- and -- she fell.
JACK: The Steward will pay for this.
BAKER: No, Jack --
JACK: After we slay the Giant, I will slay him.
BAKER: You'll do nothing of the kind.
JACK: What he done was wrong. He should be punished.
BAKER: It's not as easy as that.
CINDERELLA: MOTHER ISN'T HERE NOW.
BAKER:
(TO JACK;:
CONCILIATORY): WRONG THINGS, RIGHT THINGS
CINDERELLA: WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE'D SAY?
BAKER: WHO CAN SAY WHAT'S TRUE?
CINDERELLA: NOTHING'S QUITE SO CLEAR NOW.

CINDERELLA: HONOR THEIR MISTAKES.
BAKER: FIGHT FOR THEIR MISTAKES--
