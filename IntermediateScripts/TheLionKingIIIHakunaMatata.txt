Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  I gotta tell ya, Timon... that song always gets me right here.
Timon::  Yeah, Pumbaa. {pause} Well, enough of that. {He holds up a remote control and begins fast-forwarding through the movie}
Pumbaa::  Uh... Timon? What are you doin'?
Timon::  I'm fast-forwarding to the part where we come in!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Au contraire, my porcine pal. I've got the remote!
Pumbaa::  But everyone's gonna get confused! {He grabs a second, bigger remote} We gotta go back to the beginning of the story. {He begins rewinding the movie}
Timon::  We're not in the beginning of the story! {He pauses the movie on Rafiki holding up Simba, with a monkey screech; the movie begins fast-forwarding again}
Pumbaa::  Yes, we were—the whole time! {rewinds; the film reverses on a shot of Timon looking in bewilderment at Simba and Nala's reunion, with a squawk of confusion}
Timon::  But they don't know that! {indicates the audience; switches the movie direction again, on Nala pinning Simba, with a lion-roar sound}
Pumbaa::  Then why don't we tell them our story? {pauses the movie on a snarling close-up of the three hyenas; Timon and Pumbaa both shriek and dive under their seats}
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Oh—I like the sound of that.
Timon::  A little backstage tour. Take 'em behind the scenes for a revealing and intimate look at the story within the story!
Pumbaa::  'Cause what they don't know is how we really were there even though they didn't know we were there, y'know?
Timon::  Couldn't have said it better myself! {rewinds the movie again}
Pumbaa::  So does this mean we're going back to the beginning?
Timon::  "Digga Tunnah"
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  So majestic.
Pumbaa::  So powerful.
Timon::  So... bizarrely named. {pauses the movie; the silhouettes and the seatbacks appear again} Pumbaa, how can a rock be proud? It's a rock!
Pumbaa::  Well, I think it's because a "pride" is what they call a group of lions.
Timon:: 
Oh, sure, the lions get Pride Rock. And what about us meerkats? Where I come from we didn't have nothin' to be proud of. Why: {clears throat; singing} When I was a young meerkat...: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Thanks!
Timon::  But maybe it'd be safer if I just show 'em where I came from.
Pumbaa::  Oh, boy! Do we get to see where you grew up?
Timon::  Yeah, Pumbaa, but it ain't pretty. {clicks the remote; the view of Pride Rock switches to a full-screen shot} Please remain seated while the camera is in motion.
Timon:: 
Here we are: from Pride Rock to the pit of shame. We're so low on the food chain we're underground! But you don't have to take my word for it. I'll just let my fellow meerkats do the talking.: 
Background Chant::  Semon pute
Meerkats::  What was what?! Shh! What was that?! What was that?! Where? What? Where? Where? Shh! What was that?! Shh! Quick, before the hyena come!
Guard::  CLEAR!
Meerkats::  Dig, digga tunnah When you're done ya dig a bigga tunnah Digga tunnah, Dig, dig a tunnah Quick, before the hyena come! DIG!
Background chant::  Semon pute
Meerkats::  Digga tunnah, Dig, digga tunnah You can dig and never get dunnah
Background chant::  Semon pute
Meerkats::  Digga tunnah, (Dig a little faster) Dig, digga tunnah What was that?! {silence as they look from side to side, listening} Quick, before the hyena come! DIG! Digga tunnah is what we do Life's a tunnah we're diggin' through Digga tunnah is what we sing Digga tunnah is everything! Mud and clay is a meerkat's friend Always more around every bend And when you get to your tunnah's end Hallelujah! Let's dig again! DIG! Digga tunnah, Dig, digga tunnah (Digga tunnah) When you're done ya dig a bigga tunnah. Digga tunnah, (Dig a little faster) dig dig a tunnah. What was that?! {pause to listen} Quick, before the hyena come! DIG!
Ma::  Timon! Excuse me. Have you seen my son? Has he been through here? Timon!
Uncle Max::  Digga tunnah, dig, digga tunnah... digga tunnah, dig, dig—Aaaah! {Ma pokes him, scaring him out of his chant}
Ma::  Uncle Max?
Uncle Max:: 
Ma::  Uncle Max, relax. Have you seen Timon?
Uncle Max:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Timon:: 
Meerkat1::  Ha ha. Nice work, Timon.
Meerkat2::  Way to go, tunnel klutz.
Meerkat3::  Who else could break a hole?
Meerkat4::  Four in a week—a new record!
Ma:: 
Timon::  What? {defiantly} It's called a skylight!
Ma:: 
Timon::  I... I was just trying to shed a little light on our pathetic existence.
Ma::  Timon, this can't go on. Just this month, you've pulled down four walls and collapsed two tunnel exits. {She combs Timon's hair} We have to look after each other. Our survival depends on it.
Timon::  What's the point? All we do is dig so we can hide, and hide so we can dig. {Ma finishes combing his hair, which "poofs" up into a bunch of spikes} I wanna be where we don't have to dig tunnels and live with our heads stuck in the sand. {pushes some grass apart and gazes out over the horizon} What's so bad about dreaming of a better home?
Ma:: 
Timon::  Funny. I thought you were going a whole different direction with this.
Ma::  What can I say? It's nature's design.
Uncle Max:: 
Timon::  But when they die, they become the grass. And we eat the grass... right?
Uncle Max::  Not exactly; we can't digest grass. We're grass intolerant.
Ma:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Ma:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Timon::  I think Uncle Max dislodged one too many rocks with his skull.
Ma::  But he's right, Timon. {She tries to comb his hair again; a bug flies by, and she snatches it and squishes it into hair gel} Oh, I just know there's a way for you to fit in here.
Uncle Max:: 
Ma:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Timon::  He has a point.
Ma::  All you have to do is watch for hyenas and yell if you see one. Look at Iron Joe.
Iron Joe:: 
Timon::  Well. Now I'm convinced.
Ma::  Listen—it's outside, up in the breeze, under the wide open sky—isn't that what you want? {to Max} Or maybe you would rather have him go back on the digging crew.
Max and everyone::  NO!
Ma::  Good... then we all agree. Timon, listen to Uncle Max. He'll teach you everything you need to know. And honey, {earnestly} try to make this one work. Timon the Sentry
Uncle Max:: 
Timon::  Scream "Mommy"?
Uncle Max::  That's right, mister! Because the world out there is fraught with danger. Fraught, I tell you!
Timon:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Timon:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Timon::  Scurry, sniff, flinch. Scurry, sniff, flinch. {marimbas begin; Timon starts to get into it} Huh... I like the sound of that. Scurry, sniff, flinch. {He begins dancing more and more flamboyantly} Scurry, sniff, flinch. Scurry, sniff, flinch. Scurry, sniff, flinch!
Timon::  And bein' some other guy's snack—euugh.
Timon::  I may be delicious, organic But this little entree's fightin' back! I'm gonna put diggin' tunnels behind me And live at a new altitude I'm gonna reach for the stars to remind me That meerkats are not merely food! For once I'll be... {steps onto a cloud and surfs into a fantasy waterfall setting} Lookin' out for me... yeah! I'll tell you what I want This cat is movin' on He's a bon vivant Who's missin' out on bon I'd be a bigger cheese Far from the desert scene A little cooling breeze A little patch of green! And I'll be snoozin' in my hammock by a rippling stream Many miles from any tunnel and the digging team Looking after number one will be my only creed That's all I need {slurps up some bugs} That's all I need! I've always been good at runnin' away Well, now I'm gonna run the show-ow I've always been seen as the ultimate prey But now my status ain't so quo!
Timon::  It's hyena tiiime... oh!
Shenzi:: 
Banzai::  And I thought beans were the only musical food.
Ed:: 
Timon::  frozen in fear} Hy... Hy... Hy...
Shenzi::  Well, hi to you too! {smacks Timon, who goes rolling down the hill}
Timon::  Ayy! Ohh! Ow! Okay...
Uncle Max::  This is no time for horseplay, Timon. You're supposed to be up there lookin' out for... {sees them approaching, snickering} Hyenas!
Meerkats:: 
Banzai::  Whoa, look at 'em scramble.
Shenzi::  And that's just how I like 'em...
Meerkats::  Aah! Ooh! Uhh!
Shenzi::  ...Scrambled. {She slurps them, lifting Uncle Max into the air}
Meerkats::  Uhh!
Shenzi:: 
Meerkats::  Hyenas!
Ma::  Get in here! What are you, a meshugginah?
Ma::  Stumpy? (Here!) Flinchy? (Here!) Swifty? (Here!) Oh, what a relief. Everybody's... {gasps} Where's Uncle Max?
Uncle Max::  Aaaaahh!
Meerkat1::  Max! Run for your life!
Meerkat2::  Play dead!
Meerkat3::  Ándale!
Meerkat4::  Almost there!
Woman on TV::  Suede is the look for this fall. Of course, that is what's happening up in every magazine. What I like about it, other than you've got that long strap, which can clear your coat...
Timon::  Hey, what's goin' on? Pumbaa, you're sitting on the remote. Pumbaa Huh? Oh, sorry. I thought it was a brownie.
Meerkat5::  You've got it, Max!
Meerkats::  Max! Is he all right?
Uncle Max::  I flinched when I should've scurried. {collapses}
Banzai::  Ha ha! Oh, man! It just never gets old, does it?
Shenzi::  Ooh, the classics never do, honey.
Timon::  I, uh... I guess I owe everyone an apology. {pause} All right, so I made a teensy mistake. Like we all haven't broken into song on sentry duty before. Ha ha ha... come on. Let me have a show of hands. {The meerkats all wander off, disgusted; Timon tries to change tactics} Okay. ...Maybe it's a little too soon, but I'm sure we're all gonna laugh about this someday. Trust me.
Uncle Max::  I did trust you.
Timon:: 
Ma::  Ohh. Aw, sweetie.
Timon::  I'm never gonna fit in here. Nobody even likes me.
Ma::  Sure they do, honey. Sure they do!
Timon::  Besides you, Ma.
Ma::  Uh, besides me? Um, there's, uh...
Timon::  I have to find my place; but it isn't here.
Ma::  Yes it is. We just haven't found it yet. But we will... {She combs his hair again} Oh, here's an idea. You can run a trail—
Timon:: 
Ma:: 
Timon:: 
Ma:: 
Ma::  Ooh. Ooh, I love you. Mmm!
Timon::  I love you, Ma.
Ma::  Oh, Timmy. My Timmy. Mmm-mmm...
Timon:: 
Ma::  Ooh. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Timon
Timon:: 
Ma::  Oh, I know you will! {wistful} You will.
Ma:: 
Timon::  I will!
Ma::  Don't talk to strangers!
Timon::  I know, Ma!
Ma::  Remember, wash behind your ears!
Timon::  Ma, I'm not a kid any more!
Ma::  Never go swimming without a buddy!
Timon::  Got it!
Ma:: 
Timon:: 
Ma::  I said, send us a message!
Timon::  What?!
Ma::  I said, send us a—
Timon::  "Look Beyond What You See"
Timon:: 
Rafiki:: 
Timon::  How convenient. Enter omniscient monkey, right on cue.
Pumbaa::  Well, you know what they say. When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
Timon::  That's it. No more fortune cookies for you.
Timon::  Hey, where'd you come from?
Rafiki:: 
Timon:: 
Rafiki::  I didn't have the pleasure.
Timon:: 
To recap: I want to live in some beautiful place, outside... a carefree place where I don't have to hide or worry.: 
Rafiki:: 
Timon::  Harpoon a tomato?
Rafiki::  Hakuna Matata, it means "No Worries."
Timon::  Perfect! Mind taking that stick of yours and drawing me a map, bub? {Rafiki smacks him over the head with the stick} Ow! Hey!
Rafiki:: 
Timon::  What the heck is that supposed to mean?
Rafiki::  It means, look beyond what you see!
Timon:: 
Timon::  Who was that strange monkey? Ah, well. Dream home, here I come.
Timon::  Ah... oh-h... hello? Strange but wise monkey? {A flock of birds takes off and startles him again. He climbs up on a rock; then he hears a weird grunting roar, and sees a bulky shape rushing in his direction. He tumbles off the rock and rushes blindly through the grass as the ominous roaring sound pursues him.} Oh! Oh! Aah!
Pumbaa::  Aaaah!
Timon::  Aaaah!
Pumbaa::  Aaaah!
Timon::  Aaaah!
Pumbaa::  Aaaah!
Timon::  Aaaah!
Pumbaa::  You know, first impressions are very important.
Timon::  Oh, I thought you were a scream.
Pumbaa and Timon::  Aaaahh!
Timon::  Just eat me now... and please make it fast. I got a low threshold for pain.
Pumbaa::  Easy, easy there, little guy. I'm not gonna eat you.
Timon::  What? you're not? {indignant} Then why were you stalking me?
Pumbaa::  Well, gee, I saw you go by and I figured a little fella like you shouldn't be out here all alone.
Timon::  Hey, what about you? You're all alone. {suddenly apprehensive} You are all alone, aren't you?
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Yeah, I drive almost everyone away. People see me comin' and they run for cover. They can't get out of the way fast enough.
Timon::  You don't say, you don't say. Must be the gleam on those vicious tusks, huh? Strikes fear inte their hearts.
Pumbaa::  Actually, they say I wreck their appetite.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Perfect! You're hired.
Pumbaa::  Great! ...For what?
Timon::  To get me to a little worry-free haven out of that big pointy rock. {indicates Pride Rock}
Pumbaa::  And... you want me to come with you?
Timon::  Ha ha! Do you see any other big lovable chunk of warthog here, who also happens to have razor-sharp tusks and the ability to repel predators? {grins ingratiatingly}
Pumbaa::  I'm your pig.
Timon::  You and me, I can tell... we see eye to eye.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Whoa, easy there, big fella. I'd say more like {making "quotes" with his fingers"} acquaintances.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Put 'er there, acquaintance. {they shake paws} I'm Timon.
Pumbaa::  Pumbaa!
Timon::  No, really. {Pumbaa grins sincerely at him.} All right then. Let's hit the road.
Pumbaa::  You got it... acquaintance.
Timon::  So clear up one thing for me. If you weren't gonna eat me, what kind of a wacky wild pig are you?
Pumbaa::  I'm an insectivore.
Timon::  Oh ho! A bug eater! Well, me too. I just never had a name for it. I'm kinda partial to the crawly critters myself. How about you, big boy?
Pumbaa::  I prefer the ones with wings.
Timon::  Pumbaa, this could be the start of a beautiful... acquaintanceship. Pumbaa's Special Power
MS::  Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
BS::  Sithi uhhmm ingonyama
Pumbaa::  Okay, so now we're back at the beginning. Right, Timon?
Timon::  Oh, you got that right, pally. {narrating} At last, things were looking up. I had the sun on my shoulders, the wind at my heels, a song in my heart. {Timon and Pumbaa freak out as the animals all bear down on them} Aah!
Pumbaa::  Aah!
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Uhh, Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa. You're a pig. It's a compliment!
Pumbaa:: 
FS::  It's the Circle of Life And it moves us all...
Timon::  Whoo-hoo! There it is, the big pointy rock! Oh, baby, we're almost there.
Pumbaa::  I think we're little late.
Timon::  It's a land rush. That loudmouth monkey! He must've blabbed it to the whole world!
Pumbaa::  What exactly did he say?
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  So maybe you're supposed to look beyond the big pointy rock.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Hmm?
Timon::  Well... let's have a little look, shall we? Beyond what I see... beyond what I see... beyond what I see... {Camera pans past Pride Rock (where Rafiki is carrying Simba to the tip of the promontory) and all the gathered animals to a small hill with a little cave in it right behind the Rock.} Oh ho! What do you know? The monkey's got an eagle eye for real estate!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  He-he-hey! It's the monkey!
Pumbaa::  What's that he's holdin' up?
Timon::  Aw, who cares? It's not important. Come on! My dream home awaits. Pumbaa Uh... I don't do so well in crowds. Maybe we better go around.
Timon::  Don't you know the shortest distance between me and my dream home is a straight line? Follow me! {He leads Pumbaa straight into the breach.}
Animal1::  Oh.
Timon::  Excuse me!
Animal2::  Ow.
Animal3::  Hello!
Animal4::  Goodness.
Timon::  Make room, make room. Watch it, Twiggy. I'm walkin' here!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa. We'll have a plenty of time to chat once we settle in.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  It'll pass. Trust me! It'll pass.
Zebra1::  Oh, look. The rhinos are bowing.
Zebra2::  Ooh, we'd better bow, too.
Zazu::  Look, sire, how they kneel before the royal son.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Uh, you mean, you don't mind?
Timon::  Ha ha! Are you kidding? It was a gas! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Yeah, that's probably for the best. {Pause for a beat.} Let's go, Pumbaa!
Pumbaa::  Lead the way!
Timon::  This is it, buddy-boy. Home sweet home! And I don't gotta share it with anybody. Ha ha ha!
Pumbaa::  Don't you get, you know, lonely out here?
Timon::  Lonely? Try commitment-free. {ties up a hammock and lies down} The elbow-to-elbow life reminds me a little too much of home. This place has everything. Cool refreshments {Pumbaa hands him a massive bowl of slush}, cozy little hammock, a lovely water feature—and it's all mine.
Pumbaa::  Oh. {takes in the fact that he's not being factored in; tries to handle it bravely} Well... it's really coming together, Timon, so, uh, so I guess I'll just be going. {walks off slowly}
Timon::  Wait a minute, now wait-wa-wait. There's no law that says you have to go. I mean, if you want—
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Ahh... Good night.
Timon::  Sleep tight.
Pumbaa::  Dream of bedbugs tonight.
Timon::  Ahh.
Timon::  Timon's Dream Home
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Noisy neighbours. There go the property values.
Simba::  ...Standing in the spotlight!
Chorus::  Let every creature go for broke and sing Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing It's gonna be king Simba's finest fling
Chorus::  Oh, I just can't wait to be king! Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Timon::  Oh, perfect. We moved to the theater district! Get a load of these guys. {He thwacks an elephant with his stick} Knock it off!
Chorus::  Oh, I just can't wait...
Pumbaa:: 
Chorus::  ...To be king!
Timon::  Aah!
Simba::  I'm okay!
Timon::  Oy. Phew. Show people.
Timon::  Chin up, Pumbaa! {brushes a branch aside} Whoa! Our dream home's around here somewhere.
Pumbaa::  You know, Timon, I once came across a place that might be just what you're looking for. {Illustrations from TLK 1 accompany the descriptions} Spectacular waterfalls, set in a lush tropical oasis. A scrumptious array of—
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  But if you always go beyond what you see, how do you know when you're there?
Timon:: 
Zazu::  Sire, the hyenas are after the children!
Timon:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Timon::  Somethin' tells me this ain't the traveling company of "Riverdance." {They pause for a beat, then hop to their feet and "Riverdance" away off-screen}
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Huh? Oh, sorry.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Hang on, Timon!
Timon::  This is it! Good-bye, cruel world!
Timon:: 
That's it? {scoffs} Pbbb. That wasn't so bad. You can't knock old Timon down that easy! Yeah. Bring it on! {He notices an increasing roar of rushing water, and sees that they're approaching the top of a waterfall} Uh... Pumbaa? Question: is it possible to fall off the edge of the Earth?: 
Pumbaa::  Uh, technically, no. The Earth is round like a sphere, Timon, so it doesn't actually have an edge.
Pumbaa::  You mind if I pause it for a second?
Timon::  Sure, go ahead.
Pumbaa::  Be right back!
Pumbaa::  Okay, I got the jumbo so we could share. {He pauses for a beat, as he realizes Timon is just sitting there stock-still.} ...Were you just picking your nose?
Timon:: 
Timon::  Aaaaaaah!
Pumbaa::  Aaaaaaah!
Pumbaa::  Timon, you okay?
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  But... but you can't give up! We still haven't found our dream home.
Timon::  Forget it, Pumbaa. I've been dragging you down long enough. I'm goin' home... and I suggest you do the same.
Pumbaa::  Oh, I—I would if I could, but I can't.
Timon::  Oh, sure you can, buddy. I won't stop you.
Pumbaa::  No, I mean... I don't have a home.
Timon::  You don't? What happened—are you lost? {Pumbaa shakes his head, his snout flapping side to side} No place good enough for ya? {Pumbaa shakes again} What, you're all alone in this big empty world?
Timon::  Oh. {gets up} ...Truth is... I'm all alone too. {takes Pumbaa's foreleg} Pumbaa, you're the only friend I've ever had.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Yeah, Pumbaa... and friends stick together to the end.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Ohh. {blows his nose; hands the hanky back} Here, Pumbaa.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Hakuna Matata
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Forget about your place. Get a load of what I found! Talk about "beyond what you see"! {Samba music plays} Pumbaa, this is our dream home! {pulling aside vines to demonstrate} Dramatic views! {Pulling vines taut for Pumbaa to swing in them} Your very own porch swing! {The two of them relaxing in a pool which is bubbling merrily} Hot tub and spa! {pulling open a tree to reveal dozens of bugs} Well-stocked cupboard!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Timon
Such a wonderful phrase. It had this rhythm: {trying to remember} Laduda Ladada...: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Quiet, Pumbaa. I'm trying to think.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Two words.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Six syllables.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Twelve letters.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Rhymes with...
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  I gotta lambada!
Timon::  Hey! How can you dance at a time like this? I'm dyin' here! {realizes he's gone a bit too far, he lets go and backs off} Ooh. Sorry about that, pal.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Hakuna Matata. It means "no worries." Eh— {realizes} Ohhh.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Oh, you tease. {a ladybug appears on-screen, near the words HAKUNA MATATA which appear at the bottom}I love karaoke! I'm there.
Both::  Hakuna Matata What a wonderful phrase Hakuna Matata Ain't no passin' craze
Timon::  It means no worries, for the rest of your day—Wait a second.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Puhh. {opens his mouth; the ladybug staggers out, all mauled up}
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Sorry.
Timon::  Okay... but this time, show a little self control.
Timon::  Hakuna Matata! Ha-haah! {Both scream as they bungee-jump}
Both::  It means no worries For the rest of your days It's our problem-free Philosophy Hakuna Matata
Both::  Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata...
Ma:: 
Rafiki::  Oh ho ho ho ho. It means "No worries."
Ma:: 
Rafiki:: 
So, I told the boy: To find Hakuna Matata, you must look beyond what you see.: 
Ma:: 
Rafiki::  Well, actually, it's not a meta—
Ma:: 
Uncle Max:: 
Ma:: 
Rafiki:: 
Ma:: 
Thanks. Here's my first step: {jumps squarely onto Rafiki's foot}: 
Timon::  Yeeeeoooow! {Pumbaa is pulling quills out of Timon's butt with his teeth} Ay!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Yeah. Gotta be right up there with bobbing for snapping turtles. {Pumbaa plucks out another quill} Aah ha ha ha ha hoo!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Oh, please? {waggling his tail} Oh please oh please oh please oh please oh please?
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Aw, why not? One more run won't change our lives!
Both::  Yaaaah!
Timon::  Who knows why fate led us to little Simba that day? {Scene switches, slide-show style, to Pumbaa lifting Simba on his tusks, Timon looking terrified.} Maybe it was just my love of adventure... {Switch to Simba roaring in the jungle, Timon leaping up in terror} or my innate courage... {Stills show more scenes of Simba terrifying the fur off Timon} ...my valiant and fearless way of... okay, who's in charge of the freeze-frames?! {freeze on Timon doing a freakish wild-take pinned up against a tree root}
Pumbaa::  Sorry.
Timon::  Anywho... {resuming narration} Rescuing Simba was a cinch. {Pumbaa gathers up Simba on his tusks and trots off with him back to the jungle.} Then came the reeeally scary part. ...Parenthood. Parenthood
MS::  In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight
Simba:: 
Timon:: 
Simba:: 
Timon::  Go? Go where?
Simba::  You know, go. ...Bad!
Timon:: 
Timon::  When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Timon:: 
Simba:: 
Timon::  I'm counting to three.
Simba::  Yahoooo! {leaps onto a smaller branch, which breaks under his weight}
Pumbaa::  Uh-oh.
Timon::  One... Two...
Timon:: 
MS::  In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight
Simba::  Timon?
Timon:: 
Simba:: 
Timon::  You know this means you'll be up again about two hours from now.
Timon::  Hang on, Simba! I'll save you!
Simba:: 
Timon::  Whoooaaaa!
Simba:: 
Timon:: 
Timon::  Whoooaaaa!
MS::  In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight
Simba:: 
Timon:: 
Simba::  Actually, I, uh... I had a bad dream.
Timon::  Oh. Well, uh... {jabs Pumbaa in the ribs to wake him}
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Junior had a bad dream.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Simba::  All right! {He bounds over to them.}
MS::  Hush, my darling, don't fear, my darling The lion sleeps tonight Hush, my darling, don't fear, my darling The lion sleeps tonight
Simba::  Good night.
Timon::  Sleep tight.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Uyy!
MS::  My little darling Don't fear, my little darling Hey-a, oh, my little darling Oh, don't fear, my little darling Ingonyama ilele Don't fear, my little darling The Snail-Slurping Contest
Timon::  Whoa! Watch where you aim that morning breath. That should come with a warning label. Whoo, what a wake-up call! {He curls up and tries to go back to sleep}
Simba::  Heh heh heh. Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the warthog. What's the matter, pops? {patronizing} Had a little too much Hakuna Matata?
Timon::  Ooh. Sonny boy, I invented Hakuna Matata.
Simba:: 
Timon::  Sure you did, sure you did. Pumbaa, who holds the record for the world's longest bug belch?
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Simba again.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Simba.
Timon::  Grub gulping?
Pumbaa::  Simba.
Timon::  Maggot munching?
Pumbaa::  Still Simba.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Oh, uh, nobody. We never had a snail-eating contest before.
Pumbaa:: 
Pumbaa/Snail::  I told you this wasn't such a good idea!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  You've been hangin' around with the monkey again, haven't you?
Timon:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Both:: 
Chorus::  Sunrise, sunset Sunrise, sunset Swiftly fly the years
Chorus::  One season following another Laden with happiness and tears
Pumbaa::  ...So you see, that's why they call it a "dung beetle".
Simba::  Eww. You don't say. And yet, still so tasty!
Pumbaa::  Oh, yeah. And they're my favorite, too.
Timon::  Ooh! {slipping into the water} Ah! Ahhhh. Just what the doctor ordered.
Pumbaa::  Yep. After a long day of doing nothing, it's good to kick back.
Simba::  Three pals and no worries. What more could you want?
All:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  I'm out.
Simba::  Right behind you.
Simba::  Oh-ho!
Pumbaa::  Ahh ha ha!
Simba::  Ha ha ha ha!
Pumbaa::  You're killing me, ha ha! {They all relax} ...Timon, it's your turn to say good night.
Timon::  Good night.
Simba::  Sleep tight.
Pumbaa::  Dream of bedbugs tonight. {immediately falls asleep} Trouble in Paradise
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  We coulda gone on like that forever.
Timon::  Except for one teeny weeny little thing we forgot to count on.
Simba:: 
Nala:: 
Simba::  Waah!
Nala::  How did you...?
Simba::  But how did you...?
Timon::  Pumbaa] You mean because they've finally found each other like two soulmates joined across the years by the bonds of true love?
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  And I know just what it is. Pumbaa... we can't let them feel the love tonight!
Nala::  Ow!
Timon:: 
FS::  Can you feel the love tonight?
FS::  Can you feel the love tonight?
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
FS::  Can you feel the love...?
Nala::  Whoah-oh!
Timon::  Woaaahhh!
Pumbaa::  Waaahhh!
FS::  Can you feel the love tonight? The peace the evening brings The world, for once, in perfect harmony With all its living things
Timon::  Aaahh!
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  It did?
Timon::  Sarcasm is a foreign language to you, isn't it? {pointing at the lions cuddling} Look!
FS::  Can you feel the love tonight? You needn't look too far
Timon::  She's makin' those eyes.
Pumbaa::  He's smiling that smile.
Timon::  They're laughing... and hugging... and—and...
Timon::  It can be assumed
Pumbaa:: 
Both::  In short, our pal is doomed! The Storm Comes to a Head
Timon::  Ah, that's it, buddy. We gave it our best shot, but he's a goner.
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  You never give up, do you?
Pumbaa::  Look!
Simba:: 
Listen: You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? You don't even know what I've been through!: 
Nala::  I would if you'd just tell me.
Simba::  Forget it!
Nala::  Fine!
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  Uh, he can't express his feelings, and she has commitment issues?
Timon::  We won! Ya ha hahh! We split 'em up!
Pumbaa::  And, uh, that's a good thing?
Pumbaa::  Uh, he seems to be taking it kinda hard.
Timon::  Yeah, I know. Look, I...heh. But it's the best thing for us. I mean, for him!
Timon::  Ooh, let's go, Pumbaa. I think this storm's coming to a head.
Timon::  Hakuna Matata is safe at last, pal, 'cause nothing's gonna take our boy away now.
Timon::  He's gone? What do you mean, he's gone?
Nala::  It's just like the baboon said. The king has returned.
Nala:: 
Timon:: 
Nala:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Nala::  ...Simba has to go home to challenge his uncle and reclaim his rightful place as King.
Nala:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::  But, Timon... it's not really Hakuna Matata without Simba.
Timon::  What's gotten into you? Not Hakuna Matata? That's crazy talk. Crazy talk, I tell ya! Nothing's changed here. We had Hakuna Matata before Simba, and we've still got it now.
Pumbaa::  We gotta go help our friend, Timon.
Timon::  Et tu, Pumbaa? You're just gonna walk away, give up on all this? What happened to "friends stick together to the end"? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Timon::  Now, this is more like it. Elbow room! {"Elbow room" echoes an absurd number of times as the camera pulls back repeatedly; Timon collapses in despair} Uhhhh. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. {He tries to sing to cheer himself up; scene switches to various places where the trio used to hang out} Hakuna Matata... what a wonderful phrase... {weakly} Hakuna... Matata... {pathetically} ain't no passing craze... it means... unnghh... No Worries.
Rafiki:: 
Timon:: 
Rafiki::  My work here is done. "Friends Stick Together to the End"
Timon::  Friends stick together to the end.
Timon::  What was with the running? If you can call that "running."
Pumbaa::  I was giving you time to catch up.
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon::  Let's whip some grass.
Timon:: 
Timon::  Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he i—

Ed::  Aah ha ha—ohh!
Banzai::  They're talkin' about us!
Shenzi:: 
Timon and Pumbaa::  Yaaaaahh!

Ma:: 
Timon:: 
Shenzi::  Ooh, encore, encore!
Banzai::  No, no, no. You mean, "entree, entree."
Shenzi::  No, you right. Let's just eat 'em. {The hyenas advance on them}
Timon:: 
Ma:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa:: 
Timon:: 
Shenzi::  I don't think so!
Timon:: 
Shenzi:: 
Timon:: 
Pumbaa::
