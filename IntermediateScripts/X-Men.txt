COMMANDER: Turn around and face the wall.  Do it! Keep your arms down.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Mister Logan...
RECEPTIONIST (CONT): This is a non-smoking building.
LOGAN: Not anymore, bub.  Unless you're thinking of trying to take this away from me.
PERKINS: Mister Logan.  Follow me.
BOSS MAN: Stay where you are.
LOGAN: Whatever you say.  Nice mask.
BOSS MAN: You have no need to see my face.  By insisting on meeting me, you've created a atmosphere of mistrust.  However, the customer is always right... especially when he has a suitcase full of cash.  Will you do the honors, Perkins?
LOGAN: Now, hold on a second.  What's that?
BOSS MAN: A metal-detector.
LOGAN: Yeah?  What happened to a good, old fashioned frisking?
BOSS MAN: This is less offensive to most, and more effective.  What seems to be the problem?
BOSS MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): You wouldn't have been foolish enough to bring a weapon here.  You wouldn't...
BOSS MAN'S VOICE (V.O.,CONT): ... insult me like that, would you?
MONITOR MAN: Things just went sour.
LOGAN: Knock yourself out.
BOSS MAN: Disarm the gentleman, Perkins.
PERKINS: There's... there's nothing here.
BOSS MAN: There must be.  Find the gun.
BOSS MAN: The chemical weapon you came here to purchase is called Bio-thrax, Mister Logan.  Within minutes of contacting human flesh it causes blistering ulcers.
BOSS MAN (CONT): But, that's nothing compared to what it does to your lungs.  Please accept this free sample with my compliments.
BOSS MAN: What... what was that?
PERKINS: Looked like... some sort of knives.
BOSS MAN: Don't just stand there.  Get him!
MONITOR MAN: Here we go again.
RECEPTIONIST: Um... do you have an appointment?
LOGAN: I hope you brought a mop.
RINGMASTER: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... nothing you have experienced in your lifetime has prepared you for this evening's entertainment.  He will delight you.  He will shock you.  He will make your hair stand on end.  And, so, without further ado, the Malkin Brother's Traveling Circus is proud to present... BLOB!
RINGMASTER (O.S.,CONT): Yes, friends, yes... here he is.  Let your eyes try to take him all in.
RINGMASTER (O.S.,CONT): No scale can tell his true weight.  No lone tape measure can accurately reveal his girth.  But, that is not all.  Blob is much more than a man with a severe glandular problem.  Much more indeed...
RINGMASTER (O.S.,CONT): Rifles ready...       Aim...
RINGMASTER (O.S.,CONT): FIRE!
RINGMASTER (O.S.,CONT): Watch very carefully, ladies and gentlemen.  Behold the behemoth!
RINGMASTER (CONT): Don't just stand there, idiot.  Take a bow.  Give them a smile.  They love you.
BLOB: Give them a smile, Blob... they love you, Blob.  They don't love me.
BLOB (CONT): Okay, okay... relax.  It's your special time now.  Time to pamper yourself.  Time to treat yourself like a little princess.
BLOB: Hey... what the hell's going on?
PALE: Bath-time's over, fat boy.
TAN: You don't want to wrinkle.
BLOB: Who... who are you guys?
TAN: We're with the government.  We caught your act tonight.  You're quite the performer.
PALE: The Mutant Registration Act was enacted by Congress several months ago, Mister Blob. Now, are you thinking you can simply ignore the laws of these good United States, or do you only obey those certain laws that please you?
BLOB: I don't know what you're talking about, but this is my private dressing area...
PALE MAN: Let me explain something, doughboy.  You have unnatural powers.  You are a mutant and a danger to society.  So, we normal folks need to know "who," "what," and "where" you are at all times.
TOAD: Hello.
TOAD: The name's Mortise Toynbee.  Pleased to meet you.  You really don't look like much of a menace to society.
SABRETOOTH: Give him time.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): No, Sabretooth.  Let them live to tell others that the Brotherhood was here.
MAGNETO (CONT): If you treasure your own life.
MAGNETO: No reason for you to be frightened, Blob.
BLOB: I'm not frightened.  And, I could've taken care of those fellows all by myself. What did they want from me, anyway?
MAGNETO: What everyone wants... to look upon you and rationalize their own existences. But, the hour has come for you to stop accepting the label of freak.  You are not a freak.  You are the next step in homo- superior evolution.  Homo-superior.
MAGNETO (CONT): Would like to stop being hurt by humans, and instead be the one who does the hurting for a change?  Would you like that, my handsome friend?
BLOB: Yeah... yeah, I'd like that a lot.
RIKER'S ISLAND, NEW YORK CITY:
WARDEN: Why's he still wearing his metal skivvies?
DRIVER: Couldn't get it off.  They tried.  They can't even figure out what it's made of.
WARDEN: Well, we'll get it off, believe me.  I don't care if we have to use dynamite.
DRIVER: How can you hold him, anyway?  I mean, I hear once he's moving, nothing stops him.
WARDEN: Is he moving now?
DRIVER: No... but, he's all drugged up.
WARDEN: And, that's pretty much how he's going to spend the next twenty years.
SABRETOOTH (O.S.): Hie-de-hie-de-ho!  Lookie, lookie...
SABRETOOTH (CONT): Drop your guns, screw-heads.  Or, Humpty Dumpty here will have a great fall.
WARDEN: Hold your fire.  Hold on...
TECHNICIAN: Sir, sir... we've got trouble upstairs.
SECURITY CHIEF: I need men up here, right now!
BLOB: Move it... squeeze in.  Plenty of roam.
TOAD: Pure adrenaline.
TOAD (CONT): I was afraid of that.
SABRETOOTH: Nice going, Toad.  Now what do we do?
BLOB: Uh oh.
TOAD: I've had a spectacular brainstorm.
TOAD: Let her rip.
TOAD (CONT): If this doesn't wake him up, nothing will.
CYCLOPS: Knock, knock!  Who's there?!
SABRETOOTH: X-Men!
CYCLOPS: That's right.
BLOB: You hurt my friend!
ICEMAN: Who is this guy?
CYCLOPS: Scatter!
ANGEL: Give it up, Toad.
JEAN GREY: We don't want to have to hurt you.
TOAD: How's a girl like you going to hurt me?
JEAN GREY: Angel!
JEAN GREY (CONT): That's how.
CYCLOPS: You should have stayed down.
BLOB: I don't think so.
CYCLOPS: Bobby, no...
BLOB: You're going to be my great big Teddy Bear, aren't you?  Aren't you?!
BLOB (CONT): Where you going, Teddy Bear?
JUGGERNAUT: X-Men.  I hate X-Men.
JEAN GREY: Warren... wait for me...
JEAN GREY (CONT): It's me, Warren.  It's Jean.
ANGEL: It burns, Jean... it burns.
JEAN GREY: It's coming off.  You're going to be okay. I have to get back, Warren.  I have to. You just stay here.
JEAN GREY: Scott!
CYCLOPS: Jean... where were you?
JEAN GREY: Angel was hurt.  I'm sorry...
CYCLOPS: We have to get out of here... before the police come.  Can you carry us all?
JEAN GREY: I think so.  Hold on to me.
SENATOR CHESTER: We've all heard these stories about the mutant problem.  More and more we hear them.  Anyone who watched the news in the last twenty-four hours knows of the man named Cain Marko.  Wears a gigantic suit of armor... calls himself Juggernaut, for good reason, I might add.  For years, he used his incredible powers to rob banks, and he was supposed to be unstoppable. But, someone stopped him.  The National Guard did.  They had him.  They had him, that is, until last night, when he was set free by a group of mutant terrorists. And, according to witnesses, the X-Men were spotted at the scene of the crime.
SENATOR CHESTER (V.O.): Well, who are these mysterious X-Men?  If they fight for the common good, like some claim they do, then why haven't they come forward to be accounted for under the Mutant Registration Act?  Why is that?
SENATOR CHESTER (V.O.,CONT): My distinguished colleagues, the problem with mutants is they're different... ... but you can't always tell by looking. They don't carry concealed weapons.  They are concealed weapons.  So, I say it's time to seriously consider internment camps for mutants, and mandatory tattoos. Because, without these... without these, who knows where the danger lies?
XAVIER: What were we expecting?  We filled the earth with pollutants.  We depleted the ozone... sprayed every chemical imaginable on our food, and now that our progeny begins to show the evolutionary result, we act surprised, as if it were shocking.
CYCLOPS: Sir, I... I, uh, wanted to talk to you... about what happened last night.
XAVIER: You did your best, Scott.  Leave it at that.  Amends will be made, eventually.
XAVIER (CONT): I finished my latest excursion on the Internet.  The final C.S.S. UNIX code was nearly impossible, but I broke through.  I found what I was searching for...
XAVIER (CONT): He's an agent at Canada's Department H. He has the ability to heal almost any injury with unbelievable efficiency, and his bones are coated with adamantium metal, the strongest alloy known to man.
CYCLOPS: What are these... on his hands?
XAVIER: Retractable claws.  Also adamantium.  His code name is "Wolverine," and if we don't get to him soon... they will.
LOGAN: Flashbacks are coming more often now. Full of needles and torture.  They're even working their way into my dreams.
LOGAN (CONT): Somehow I don't think you're giving me your undivided attention.
HUDSON: You're the best agent we've got, Logan. You've served the Prime Minister well...
LOGAN: Don't start whistling "Oh, Canada" at me again.
HUDSON: Let me finish, ok?  You've been on Hazard Duty a long time, left a lot of damage in your wake and no one's complaining about that.  But, you've earned some nightmares.
LOGAN: No... I think these visions are pieces of memories, rattling around in my head. I want to know who I am.  I want to know who made me this way.
HUDSON: No one knows.
LOGAN: Well, I'm starting to find that harder and harder to stomach.
HUDSON: You're exactly the way you were when we found you... adamantium claws and all. Out in the wilds of the Buffalo Woods, half-insane... living like an animal.
LOGAN: As opposed to the way I'm living now?
HUDSON: What dredged this up again?
LOGAN: It's just too convenient.  Secret Service stumbles upon me, cleans me up... has their shrinks give me back some of my sanity.  All done out of the goodness of your heart, right, Hudson?  Oh, but, lucky for you, I also happened to be the ultimate killing machine.
HUDSON: Look.  Department H has tried to research your background plenty of times and it's always a dead end.  We can't even verify the name "Logan."  What more do you want?
LOGAN: Nothing.  I'm quits.  That's all.  I'll see ya in the funny papers.
HUDSON: I can't let that happen.
LOGAN: Yeah?  What're you going to do about it? You going to push a button on me?
BARTENDER: What can I do you for, friend?
LOGAN: I'm hoping you can answer me some questions.  Like, how long's this place been around, the way it is now, with the whole winter wonderland thing going on?
BARTENDER: Oh, I'd say... at least fifteen years.
LOGAN: You a townie?
BARTENDER: Born and raised.
LOGAN: And, how many years you put in here?
BARTENDER: Say... what's this all about?  You some kind of reporter or something?
LOGAN: Well... that's hard to explain.  You want the long story... ... or the short?
BARTENDER: I like stories with happy endings.  I been working this dive for about ten years.
LOGAN: Okay, good.  Do me a favor... take a hard look at me.  You ever seen me before?
BARTENDER: No... no, not that I can recall.
LOGAN: You sure?  Take your time.  It might've been a while ago.  Maybe years ago.
BARTENDER: Sorry, friend, but I think if I'd have seen that face before, I'd remember.
LOGAN: It's alright.  It was a long shot.  How about sliding me a bottle of Jack?
WAITRESS: Now, how is it you and I are going to get to know each other if you're sitting all the way up at the bar like this?
LOGAN: Darlin', you don't want to know me.  You wouldn't like me very much.
LOGAN: Don't move, pretty boy.
LOGAN (CONT): Good thinking.  You're going to be needing that in a minute.
CYCLOPS: Mister Logan, I presume.
LOGAN: Well, how about you... all calm, cool and collected.
LOGAN (CONT): That's one... That's two.  You want to go for three?
XAVIER: Back down, Wolverine.  We're friends.
LOGAN: How do you know that name?
XAVIER: I know a great deal about you.  If you want, we'll leave... but we have no quarrel with you.  Quite the contrary, in fact.  We'd like your assistance.
LOGAN: Ain't this comfy cozy... Goldielocks and the Three Mutants.  So, you want me to join your... what'd you call them?
XAVIER: X-Men.  So, named because they possess extra powers which ordinary humans do not.
LOGAN: And, how'd you manage to find me?
XAVIER: I have contacts in the international intelligence community.  But, you understand, I cannot go into details... not till I have your answer.
LOGAN: Well, how would this work, exactly?  I mean, the C.S.S. and Department H ain't just going to give me a goodbye kiss.
XAVIER: You would disappear.  Your Canadian citizenship would become null and void.
CYCLOPS: You'd live in secrecy, the same as us.
LOGAN: For the good of humanity, you said. Humanity.  Are we a part of that?
JEAN GREY: We are, unless we make the mistake of excluding ourselves.
LOGAN: You know, I could really get to liking you, sweetheart.
CYCLOPS: You're out of line, Logan.
LOGAN: Maybe.  But, then again, I never was much of a team player.  I'm declining the invitation.  Thanks anyway.
CYCLOPS: Let's go.  He's a lost cause.
XAVIER: Listen to me, Logan.  Many of the tasks you've performed for your country were questionable, not to mention your methods. I'm willing to forgive that... to put past times behind.
LOGAN: I don't remember asking forgiveness.
XAVIER: You are a murderer by trade.  This is the label which best defines you, isn't it? Murderer.  Or, will you dispute that?
LOGAN: No.  But, I can live with it.
XAVIER: Can you?  There is a war on the way. Humans against mutants, mutant against mutant... far worse than anyone imagines. And, as battles escalate, you'll be forced to choose, a side.  I'm offering you an opportunity to fight for something far more honorable than a government agenda... without killing.
LOGAN: Sorry... the answer's still "no."
LOGAN (CONT): You can show yourselves out.
SENATOR CHESTER: No, no, no, this is all wrong.  Who drafted this?  Start from scratch.  Go!
SENATOR CHESTER (CONT): Heeellllo... I'm dry here.
SENATOR CHESTER: What in tarnation... ? There's an enormous fat man on the wing!
PILOT (V.O.): ... Um, excuse me, gentlemen... this is your pilot.  We have a bit of a problem...
CO-PILOT (B.G.,V.O.): We're all going to die!
PILOT (V.O.): Shut up!
SENATOR CHESTER: What am I doing!?  This is madness!
SENATOR CHESTER: Parachutes!  Where are the parachutes?
PILOT: Sir... get back to your seat!
SENATOR CHESTER: Parachutes, man!  We need parachutes!
GYRICH: Get out.
PALE: Who's in charge here?
GYRICH: That'd be me.
PALE: Yeah, well, what gives you the right to drag us out here into the boondocks without a word of explanation?  Huh?  You think you can strong-arm us, tough-guy?
GYRICH: Do you realize you're speaking to a superior officer of the National Security Council?
PALE: No, actually I didn't, since you haven't even bothered to show us any i.d.
GYRICH: Let me rectify that.
GYRICH: There's my identification, soldier.  And, if I hear another peep out of you before I give you permission to speak, I'm going to knock both your heads together so hard you're each going to end up with the other guy's childhood memories.  Got it?  Is that clear?  Just nod if you understand.
GYRICH (CONT): Good.  Now, I have some business to finish up, but when I'm done, you're going to tell me about the mutants you ran into at that freak show, and you're going to tell me in such excruciating detail that I'll feel like I was with you.  Except, if I had been, I wouldn't have let a bunch of filthy muties beat the crap out of me.
AGENT: Mister Gyrich.  Trask on the line.
GYRICH: Why don't you two take a seat on that log there and start collecting your thoughts. I Ill get back to you when I feel like it.
LOGAN: Hey there, Hudson.  Looking for me?
HUDSON: How you can stand living around all these trees and dirt, it's beyond me.  I know you claim to have quit... but you might like to see this.  It came in on one of our ghost channels.  A request for a meeting, addressed to you, and it's not hard to figure out who sent it.
HUDSON (CONT): Department H still considers him absent without leave.  We want him back.
LOGAN: I'm in... but, only if I go alone.  No back-up.  No extraction team.
HUDSON: I figured as much.  You know, he's probably counting on that.
LOGAN: How would you like him?  Alive or dead?
HUDSON: Use your discretion.
LOGAN: I'll do that.  I'll use my discretion.
MAITRE D': Do you have a reservation, sir?  Sir?
SABRETOOTH: Logan.  Grab a seat.  We need to talk.
LOGAN: How's the mercenary business these days, Creed?  Assassinate any good foreign dignitaries lately?
SABRETOOTH: Actually, I been monogamous for a while now.  Working on a sort of a... crusade.
LOGAN: Isn't that special?
WAITER: Your... um, steak, sir.
SABRETOOTH: Hope you don't mind I ordered without you.
LOGAN: Nah.  Seeing you again, I doubt I'd be able to keep solid food down.
SABRETOOTH: Now, what kinda way is that to talk to your old spying partner?  We been through a lot together, you and me.
LOGAN: We worked together, but we were never partners.
SABRETOOTH: If looking at it like that makes you feel better, fine.  But, I been sent to ask if you want to team up again.  See... a bunch of us got something going.  It's called the Brotherhood... ... kind of a pussy name if you ask me, but anyway, we're about to be putting a big hurt on a lot a people.
LOGAN: I'm not interested, okay?  So, that's all of that, right?  You done jawing?
SABRETOOTH: Sure am.
LOGAN: You know, there's not a day goes by I don't think about how much I'd like to take you out.
SABRETOOTH: Hey, I was only fulfilling an obligation there.  I'm glad you said no.  Cause now I got an altogether different obligation to stomp you into the ground.  I've been hating you so long, I can't even remember what started it.
LOGAN: I know what started it for me.  You murdered the only woman I ever loved.
SABRETOOTH: Hah, that's right.  Now, why did I snuff her again?  Oh, yeah, I remember... didn't really have a reason... I did it for fun.
SABRETOOTH (CONT): Step right up.
LOGAN: Hold still, ya freak!
SABRETOOTH: Anyone for an after dinner espresso?
LOGAN: Say goodnight, Gracie.
MAGNETO: You should have joined us, Wolverine. What a pitiful waste of talent.
SABRETOOTH: You're too much, shrimp.  Trying to kill me... you almost killed yourself.
SABRETOOTH (CONT): Silly me... did I say almost?
XAVIER: What have we got, Robert?
ICEMAN: The thermal sensors and radar are going crazy, but they're being taken out before they can cross-reference.  Watch...
ANGEL: This is Angel.  I'm at the front gate. The perimeter's definitely been breeched.
XAVIER (V.O.): Jean... can you hear me?
JEAN GREY (V.O.): I'm here, Professor.
XAVIER'S VOICE (V.O.): The intruder has entered the mansion.
JEAN GREY: Scott, he's inside the house.
JEAN GREY: Logan.
LOGAN: Your security system could use some improvements.
LOGAN (CONT): ... nice catch...
JEAN GREY: What happened to you?
LOGAN: Bad things, darlin'... bad things.
XAVIER (CONT): The dining rooms, kitchen and parlor are found in the other wing.  As you can see, everything on this floor and above has been designed to be viewed by the general public.  As far as they know, this is merely a school for gifted students.
XAVIER (CONT): The sub-basements, however, are an entirely different matter.
XAVIER: The War Room.  We've tapped into NORAD Central Command, the F.B.I. and C.I.A... even your Department H.  All civilian, military, and police data is harvested, twenty four hours a day.
LOGAN: I hope you don't expect me to learn Word Perfect. Why are you trusting me... showing me all your secrets right off the bat?
XAVIER: Trust is the only thing of any value I'm showing you.  You already know the one piece of information that could hurt the X-Men most.  Our location.
LOGAN: Now that you mention it, how did I know that?  I mean, I came right here...
XAVIER: The night we met, I planted it in your mind, hidden away with a memory trigger attached.  So, the moment you decided to accept my offer, the trigger was activated and the information was revealed to you.
LOGAN: You did that, without me even knowing.
XAVIER: And, I do apologize.  Normally I feel such uninvited intrusions are wrong, but I felt I had no choice.  As a telepath, I face innumerable moral dilemmas every day.  You can only begin to imagine.  Right now, for example, I could read your every thought with ease... if I choose to.
XAVIER (CONT): This is Cerebro.  Its sensors constantly sweep the globe, piggy backing existing satellite projections.  By linking with it, I have the ability to detect the unique waves of psionic energy emitted by super humanly powerful mutants.
XAVIER (CONT): It unfortunately cannot specify exact locations.  However, I have recently discovered an unusual gathering of mutants in and around New York City.
LOGAN: The Brotherhood... and Sabretooth.  Who's running that road show, anyway?  Who's the guy who turned me into a giant magnet?
XAVIER: The time will come for this discussion. Till then, I have to ask you not to mention that incident to the other X-Men.
JEAN GREY: Not bad.
BEAST: Not bad at all.
CYCLOPS: Not good enough.
XAVIER: Logan... you've already met Jean Grey, and our team leader, Scott Summer, or Cyclops. And, this is Warren Worthington the Third. Nicknamed Angel, for obvious reasons.
LOGAN: Worthington, huh?  As in Worthington Industries?
ANGEL: I'm Chairman and principal stockholder.
LOGAN: How does a mutant manage that?
ANGEL: In this age of teleconferencing and fax machines, it's not too hard.
XAVIER: This busy gentleman over here is Henry McCoy.  Biochemist and genetic researcher extraordinare, otherwise known as Beast.
BEAST: A distinct pleasure meeting you.  I'd shake hands, but I don't have a free one.
XAVIER: Beast is putting our young Iceman, Robert Drake, through his paces. Come look.  We call this the Danger Room.
XAVIER (V.O.): That's enough for today, Robert.
BEAST: A disappointing score for Bobby Drake, ladies and gentlemen.  If only he could have landed that triple axle.
CYCLOPS: Alright, Beast, alright.  We all know he needs lots of practice.
JEAN GREY: He has to learn to react quicker.
BEAST: More quickly, actually.
XAVIER: He will.  See to it, Scott.  Spend some extra time with him.
XAVIER (CONT): So... what do you think?
LOGAN: It looks fun.  When's my turn?
CYCLOPS: It's not fun, Logan.  It's for real.  I doubt you're ready for it.
LOGAN: Hey, I'm for real too, Cyke, so it's a perfect match.  Or, didn't your mommy teach you to share your toys?
CYCLOPS: You don't know anything about the D.R. except what you just saw.  You go in now, you're just going to get yourself killed.
LOGAN: Well, why don't we let the big man decide?
CYCLOPS (V.O.): You still want to do this?
LOGAN: I'm waiting.
CYCLOPS: Last chance to change your mind.
LOGAN: Shut your cake-hole.
LOGAN: You'll have to do better than...
CYCLOPS: I'm shutting it down.
XAVIER: No.  Let him continue.
CYCLOPS: My God...
LOGAN: I'm going to Disneyland.
CYCLOPS: He's not one of us.
XAVIER: You must have patience.
CYCLOPS: Besides his... his berserker instincts... putting that aside for a moment, we still both know the only reason he's here is to get another crack at Sabretooth.
XAVIER (CONT): Wolverine is an X-Man now, Scott.  Like you, or Iceman... any of you.  One by one, you came to me, or I sought you out.  And now that Logan has come, he is just as deserving of chance to learn to control his abilities.  We need him, and although he may not know it yet... he needs us.
LOGAN (O.S.): Nice night for a dip, sweetheart.
JEAN GREY: What can I do for you, Logan?
LOGAN: You're doing it.
LOGAN (CONT): Aw... you don't have to be shy around me.
JEAN GREY: Let me explain something, before you try to take this relationship beyond the leering stage...
LOGAN: I know... you already got a boyfriend.  A certain fella goes by the name of Cyclops. That night in my cabin, I could smell your lipstick on pretty-boy's breath.  So, either you two had been smooching it up, or he was borrowing your shade.  But, it doesn't bother me.  It's a woman's prerogative to change her mind.
JEAN GREY: Good night, Logan.  Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite... as if they'd try.
LOGAN: What's your hurry?
JEAN GREY: Something about being alone in a room with you makes me uneasy.
LOGAN: That's my animal magnetism.
JEAN GREY: No, it's fear.
LOGAN: Afraid you're going to fall in love.
JEAN GREY: Afraid you're a lunatic.
LOGAN: Crazy for you.
LOGAN (CONT): Logan... you are a heel.
CYCLOPS: What's the matter?
JEAN GREY: Hm?  Oh, nothing. Really.  Just thinking.  That's all.
JEAN GREY: We have to tell them.
CYCLOPS: Tell them what?
JEAN GREY: Scott, I'm tired of sneaking in here every night, and then having to hurry back to my own room before the sun comes up.
CYCLOPS: But, what are they going to say?  And, with Professor Xavier... around him I still feel like... like some little kid.
JEAN GREY: We shouldn't worry what the others will think or say.  We shouldn't have to worry.
JEAN GREY (CONT): I wish, just once... I'd give anything to be able to look into your eyes.  Just once in my lifetime.
CYCLOPS: You know that can never happen.  These lenses are the only thing keeping me from destroying everything I look at.  Without them... without them, who knows?
ANGEL: I don't care what's hot in the Asian Bond Markets, Jack.  S...E...L...L, got it? Now, what's MRV's close?  Okay... lock in one millions shares.  And, by the way, whatever happened to those ballet tickets?
ANCHOR'S VOICE (V.O.): ... alliance of mutant terrorists calling themselves "The Brotherhood" has claimed responsibility for the bombing.  Here is a portion of the message we received just moments before the explosion:
MAGNETO'S VOICE (V.O.): The thunder you hear across a cloudless sky is not the sound of a storm rising. It is the sound of mankind falling.
MAGNETO'S VOICE (V.O.,CONT): If it is your desire to fear mutants, it will be our pleasure to give you something worth fearing.  If you hate us, we gladly hate you back.  And, if you attempt to imprison us, we will rise up, and we will build our cities with your bones.
XAVIER: Beast and I leave for Manhattan within the hour.  I would like very much to see a marked improvement in this team upon my return.  Will I see such an improvement, Scott?  Can I depend on that?
CYCLOPS: Where there's room for improvement.  Yes.
XAVIER: There is one other thing.  Angel... you are no longer required to participate in Danger Room exercises.  I've decided you'll serve as only a pilot and a scout.
ANGEL: What?
XAVIER: You are talented, son, but your skills are not enough in a combat.  You're too vulnerable.
ANGEL: This isn't fair.  You're overreacting to one incident.
JEAN GREY: I have to agree with Angel.
XAVIER: I'm sorry, it's not open to discussion. The destruction of the Citicorp building was only a prelude...
ANGEL: So, that's it?  Suddenly, I'm just some junior-league flunkey?
ICEMAN: Since when do we run things this way?
XAVIER: The darkest days of our lives lie just ahead for all of us and we have little time to make ready.  So, in this one instance, this is how it will be, without question.  Is that understood?
BEAST: What exactly was that back there, Charles? Tough love?
XAVIER: It had to be done. How harsh was I?
BEAST: Perhaps you were right to limit Angel's participation, but a quote by Mark Twain does come to mind regarding your delivery.
XAVIER: And it is... ?
BEAST: "Intemperate temperance injures the cause of temperance, while temperate temperance helps it in its fight against intemperant intemperance."  Or, in other words, "chill out."  Just a little.
XAVIER: I'll try to remember that.  Thank you.
BEAST: Just what do we hope to accomplish on this breezy jaunt into the Big Apple?
XAVIER: I'm not certain yet.  We may be looking up an old acquaintance of mine.
BEAST: Interesting.  Care to elaborate?
XAVIER: No.
BEAST: Alright then.  As long as you don't make me sit through "Cats" again. Uh oh...
XAVIER: Oh my.
XAVIER: No.  Not this time.  You know how I feel about this.
BEAST: I understand your reticence, but what choice do we have.  It's harmless...
XAVIER: I won't do it.  I simply will not.
BEAST: Okay, okay.  The only other thing I can think of is for you to switch places with me, and I could hunker down and hope he doesn't notice me.  But, that might be a problem, if, say, oh... the officer happens to ask you to step out of the car.
XAVIER: Alright... alright.  Take off your hat.
MEL GIBSON: Howdi there, officer.  Jeez, was I going too fast or something?
POLICEMAN: Hey... I know you.  You're that actor guy... in all those great cop movies where everything explodes.
MEL GIBSON: Yeah, well, that's me.  I, uh, was also in this thing called "Hamlet," but anyway...
MEL GIBSON (CONT): Don't mind him.  That's my agent there. He's got a really bad migraine headache... had a busy day back-stabbing and double- dealing.  Listen, I'm on my way into town for a big movie premiere, and I was kind of hoping you might, you know... see your way clear to letting me slide this time. Just this once.
GYRICH: Welcome to the Compound, Trask.  Your illegally siphoned tax dollars at work.
TRASK: Thank you.  It's very nice.  Um, now... if I could be shown my room, I'm exhausted...
GYRICH: Later.  First, I want a look-see at the goodies you brought me.
XAVIER: News reports said it was an explosion that took the building down, as if it were a bomb.  But, I have a strong feeling they haven't been told the truth.
BEAST: Lord... who could have done this?
LOGAN: You want it?
LOGAN (CONT): You do quality work, Frosty.  Don't let anybody tell you different.
ICEMAN: I aim to please.
CYCLOPS: Um... you might want to get rid of those.
JEAN GREY: Oh, ye of little faith.
LOGAN: Give me a friggin' break.  What's this stupid game supposed to teach us again?
ICEMAN: Threat assessment... team work...
LOGAN: Truth, justice and the American way. Well, nuts to all that.  You want to win?
ICEMAN: I'd love to.  Nobody's ever beaten Cyclops and Jean when they're paired up.
LOGAN: Yeah, they got a real synergy going. Well, them days is over.  From here on out, it's you and me and create-tive-ity.
ANGEL (O.S.,V.O.): No coming over the top, wolverine.
LOGAN: Now we know where we're going.  All we go to do is get there.  And, the shortest distance between two points...
LOGAN (CONT): ... is right through here.  Watch my back.
ICEMAN: I'm there.
CYCLOPS (CONT): We made it.
CYCLOPS: Close, Logan, but not close enough.  I bet you could almost taste it.
LOGAN: That's alright.  The better man won.  Put her there...
LOGAN (CONT): I don't remember hearing the final bell.
LOGAN (CONT): Now the game's over, and you lose.  It's mighty nice being king of the hill, but you got to be ready to defend it.
ICEMAN: That was dirty pool.
LOGAN: That was winning, kid.  You'll recognize it after you've done it a few times.
LOGAN (CONT): What were you thinking?
CYCLOPS: Let's go... you and me.
JEAN GREY: Stop this.  Are you crazy?  Stop it!
ICEMAN: Ease back, Logan.  Step off.
CYCLOPS: Okay... okay, I'm alright.
LOGAN: Nothing worse than a sore loser, One-eye. You should learn to take it like a man.
BEAST: Whomever it is leading the Brotherhood... well, it seems Charles may have had dealings with him in the past.
JEAN GREY: If that's so, why didn't he tell us?
BEAST (V.O.): He may feel we're not ready to hear the full truth just yet.  In the Battle of Britain, the Royal Air Force was very heavily outnumbered by the German Luftwaffe.  I doubt each man flying for Britain truly comprehended the enormity of the odds against him.  Yet, after three months of fighting, the RAF handed Hitler his first major defeat of world War Two. It was of this battle Churchill said, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."
ICEMAN: Man, where do you get all this stuff from?
BEAST (V.O.): Churchill also said, "It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations."
CYCLOPS: Where's Professor Xavier now?
BEAST: In the other room here.  He's gone into some sort of deep, psionic trance.
CYCLOPS (V.O.): What?
BEAST: As far as I can tell, he's reaching out across the entire city with his mind... sorting through the millions of states of consciousness around us...
BEAST (V.O.): He's calling out the Brotherhood leader.
JEAN GREY: Can I talk to you for a minute?
JEAN GREY (CONT): I've been thinking about you.
LOGAN (CONT): Yeah?  With or without clothing?
JEAN GREY: Give it a rest for once, Logan.  A little of that garbage goes a long way.
LOGAN: Alright.  What's up?
JEAN GREY: If I ask you a straight question, will you answer honestly?
LOGAN: Depends what the question is.  Try me.
JEAN GREY: Why are you still alive?
LOGAN: Want to run that by me again?
JEAN GREY: If the records Professor Xavier dug up from Department H are anywhere near accurate, you've been shot at least a hundred and twenty times in the line of duty.  You've been stabbed over sixty times.  You've been bludgeoned, burned... you even went over Niagara Falls.  Yet there you sit, alive and well.  But, what keeps you going?  It can't all be because of your healing factor.  Not all of it. To survive what you have, it would take this unbelievable rage to live.
LOGAN: What are you getting at?
JEAN GREY: Well, like I said, I've been thinking about you, and there's something I don't get.  I mean, what in the world could you possibly be living for?  You don't care about anyone, and it's pretty clear you loath yourself.  Most people have someone they care about.  So, I wonder, what does Logan look forward to?  Does he look forward to the next time he has the pleasure of digging his claws into someone?  Is he just, in his heart of hearts, breathlessly anticipating his next victim's last gasp?  Is that enough?  It couldn't be... but, what else is there for him?
JEAN GREY: Oh my, did I hurt your feelings?
LOGAN: Maybe you better leave.
JEAN GREY: It's interesting... I was about to say the same thing to you.
LOGAN: You asked.  Do you really want to know?
LOGAN (CONT): I'm here, sitting with you.  Right?  Okay. Before that, I worked for Department H a bunch of years, and just before that I was living in a forest in Canada, running around, killing and eating and howling at the moon.  That's as far back as my memory goes, and its got some pretty rough edges as is.  So, while you might have a recollection of some freckled faced brat pulling your pigtails in kindergarten, or the first time you rode a bike without training wheels, I have these... I've had them every single day of what little of my life I remember.  I don't even know if they belong to me.  There's not a single picture in here that has me in it, or that means anything when I look at it.  But still... is this my mother? Is this my father, or my brother?  And, that's the whole other thing.  With my healing and all, it's a good bet I don't age too fast.  So, I could be thirty years old, or a hundred, in which case my past is ancient history.
JEAN GREY: Why are some of the corners bent?
LOGAN: Those are ones where I looked for that person, or went to that place.  I ain't found nothing yet, but someday one of these pictures is going to tell me who I am.  Other than that... I don't do a whole lot of looking forward.
XAVIER: Henry... wake up.  Wake up.
XAVIER (CONT): He's here.  He's very close.
XAVIER: Henry!
GYRICH: He's still standing, boys!
TROOPER ONE: Fire in the hole!
GYRICH: Hit him again!
SHARPSHOOTER: Who's Kojak here?
SHARPSHOOTER (CONT): Do we take him?
GYRICH: What good's a cripple do us?  Leave him where he lays.  Let's go.
MAGNETO: Xavier... my dear fellow.  What have you gotten yourself into?
MAGNETO: Welcome back to the land of the living.
XAVIER: Eric.  What have you done with Beast?
MAGNETO: Not me.  The government took him.  Though, I did help them along with an anonymous call to the National Security Council.
XAVIER: If they harm him in any way, I swear...
MAGNETO: What?  What do you swear?  You should be grateful.  I spared your life.  I'm sparing it with each passing second, and I could take it with a wave of my hand.
XAVIER: And, with a thought, I could destroy your mind.  My abilities are stronger now than they used to be.
MAGNETO: A stalemate, then... of mutual assured destruction.
XAVIER: Why didn't you kill me?
MAGNETO: I suppose I don't really want you dead, Charles.  I want you with me, at my side... like the good old days.  The offer I make to you this evening is the offer I will soon make to the world... "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled mutants yearning to breath free." There's a place for you in the Brotherhood, and for your X-Men.
XAVIER: We want no part of wholesale slaughter, or of your desire to see homo-sapiens enslaved by homo-superior.
MAGNETO: You still dream of co-existence, don't you?  You still think man and mutant can live together.
XAVIER: I do.
MAGNETO: The battle you've chosen has left great men dead in it's wake.
XAVIER: That doesn't mean it's not worth fighting.
MAGNETO: Oh, you amaze me.  Look at all the killing and "ethnic cleansing" going on in this world.  Look at what has happened to Beast.  Man's inhumanity to man is ageless and timeless.  If the Congress had their way... the great leaders of this nation, they'd have you in chains, with a number burned into your forehead.
XAVIER: But, they won't have their way.
MAGNETO: If not for me, they would.
XAVIER: No.  Their hatred comes from fear, and you feed that fear.  By the assassination of a United States Senator, by acts of random terrorism, you're only widening the rift.
MAGNETO: By the time I'm done, that rift will be a gaping chasm.
XAVIER: Then, what good are you doing?  Why not join with me to help heal this bigotry, instead of adding to it?
MAGNETO: Because, if you want to be heard in a room full of people screaming at the top of their lungs, you have to be the one who screams the loudest and the longest.  You have to roar into the maelstrom. I'd love to share my plans with you.  I once thought of you as my only friend.  I give you one last chance to join me, because against me, you will never win.
XAVIER: We're ready for you.
MAGNETO: You wear your brave face well.  Pity it will soon turn to a mask of sorrow.
MAGNETO (CONT): One last thing, Charles.  I know you have him.  Your animal pet, with his big sharp claws.  He will not save you.
CYCLOPS: You got a problem, Logan?
LOGAN: Not anymore I don't.
CYCLOPS: You want to be the lone wolf... you stop breathing... no great loss.  All I care is you're letting down the rest of the team.
LOGAN: Hey, you can jump around all day in that Romper-Room world of yours it don't mean squat compared to fighting flesh and blood.  I'm sick of playing games.
CYCLOPS: You're pissed because you screwed up down there, and you know it.  What was it you said about taking it like a man?
JEAN GREY: Scott... come on.  Let him stew.
LOGAN: Chrimany, Jean, what do you see in this nebbish?  What'd he do to deserve you?
JEAN GREY: Let it go.
LOGAN: You're whipped.
LOGAN: You just earned some big time lumps, bub.
CYCLOPS: Outside.
ICEMAN: This I got to see.
JEAN GREY: Idiots.  Macho idiots.
CYCLOPS: This is me and him, Bobby, man to man. You stay out of it.
ICEMAN: No kidding.
LOGAN: You mean mutant to mutant.
CYCLOPS: No.  No powers.  No claws.  No visor.
ANGEL: This should be good.
LOGAN: You're out of your league.
XAVIER (V.O.): Iceman!
ICEMAN: You sure about that?
LOGAN: What the... ?
ICEMAN: Sorry, guys.
XAVIER: His name is Eric Magnus Lehnsherr.  He has an ability to control and manipulate magnetic energy.  I knew him during a time I spent wandering from country to country, working in hospitals and psychiatric facilities... wherever they would accept my help.  I first met Magnus in Haifa, Israel.  He was a foreign aid volunteer.
XAVIER (CONT): Our paths crossed many times after that, and we often traveled together, a two man amnesty force of sorts.  We both know we were different from others, without ever speaking it.  The only times we discussed human evolutionary mutation were to debate its effects on future history.  Magnus believed that as the Homo Superior grew in number... ... their only hope for survival would be to take dominion over man, and he now seems to be making his second attempt to achieve that goal.
JEAN GREY: His second?
XAVIER: A long time ago, we worked in a small clinic behind the Iron Curtain.  One evening, two badly wounded teenagers were brought in.  Nothing could be done to save them.  We later learned that these two, a boy and girl, had been dragged from their home and beaten by an angry mob.  Because they were mutants.  Because they shared telepathy.  Magnus decided to avenge them, and would not be dissuaded. The town we were in was called Chernobyl.
XAVIER (CONT): This was the result.  The Chernobyl nuclear disaster.  April 26, 1986.  The first time Magnus and I truly revealed our powers to each other... against each other.  I know I've told you differently before, but it was during this fight that I lost the use of my legs.
XAVIER (CONT): I blacked out from the pain, and woke up in a hospital far away from this.  I can only guess at Magnus' regret, because the assault had ended before a meltdown.  But still, more than six hundred thousand people received high doses of radiation, almost half of them children.
CYCLOPS: And, now he has his sights set on New York City.
XAVIER: This sensor array can read the fluctuations in the magnetic spectrum which surround Magnus at all times.  With luck I'll have it adapted to visual mode by this evening.  It will be your job to use it over Manhattan, Angel, under cover of darkness.  You are the best chance we have of locating the Brotherhood.
ICEMAN: What about Beast?
CYCLOPS: If the government has him hidden away, a search party won't do much good.  For all we know, they've taken him out of state.
XAVIER: I'll begin a psychic search as soon as possible, once I've fully recovered from the strain of finding Magnus.  Other than that... I don't know what we can do.
LOGAN: Okay, look.  With Beast missing in action, you want to get big-time serious, right? So, I feel like I got to say, if we're going to have a fighting chance against these guys, we need a new team leader. Cause Cyclops ain't cutting it. No offense.  It's just the truth.
CYCLOPS: I suppose you think you're born to lead?
LOGAN: You got it, mono-brow.
XAVIER: Enough!  Haven't either of you heard a word I've said?  Why must you insist on this inane competition?
LOGAN: Maybe I'm not the only one here on the "Island of Misfit Toys" who feels like Cyclops is dropping the ball.  But even if I am,it can't hurt to have a vote.
LOGAN (CONT): One man, one ballot.  Let the democracy decide.  That's all I'm asking.
XAVIER: Very well... you'll have your vote.
CYCLOPS: What?
XAVIER (CONT): It's the only equitable way.  I want each of you to consider this carefully, alone. It's important you not discuss it.  We will meet in the West Wing in two hours.
CYCLOPS: What's going on, Professor?  Are you having your own doubts about me now?
XAVIER: We'll speak afterwards.
JEAN GREY: What are you doing in here?
LOGAN: Visiting.
JEAN GREY: Get out, Logan.  You heard what Professer Xavier said.
LOGAN: Yeah, I heard.  But, when else do I get a chance to talk to you without Cyclops hanging around, or you around him?
JEAN GREY: Just, leave.
LOGAN: Why?  You still afraid?
JEAN GREY: What do you want from me?
LOGAN: Show me you're not afraid.  Why do you keep backing away?
JEAN GREY: I'm not afraid of you.
LOGAN: I'm glad.
JEAN GREY: I... I don't want this.
LOGAN: I can't help that. Far as I'm concerned, you're deciding on more than just team leader today.
XAVIER: One ballot for Cyclops. One ballot for Logan.
XAVIER (CONT): Another vote for Cyclops.
XAVIER (CONT): Another for Logan.
XAVIER (CONT): So... this will break the tie. It's for Cyclops.  He remains team leader.
ICEMAN: Well, wasn't that a cheery affair?  I'm so glad I could be here.  Thanks everyone.
ANGEL: I hope you had a good reason for putting Scott through that, Professor.
XAVIER: I expect you to abide by this decision, Logan.
LOGAN: Well, you lose some, and you win some.
JEAN GREY: I didn't vote for you.
JEAN GREY (CONT): This here... this didn't even have anything to do with the fact that I love Scott.  But, I do love him.  I care about you.  But, I love him.
LOGAN: Sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
JEAN GREY: You're wrong.
XAVIER: I feel quite safe making the assumption that Logan cast his own ballot with his name on it.  But, the second vote for Logan... that surprised me.  Especially since it was you who cast it.
CYCLOPS: It didn't surprise you at all, did it?
XAVIER: The moment Angel locates the Brotherhood, you take the X-Men into battle.  You must believe in yourself as much as they do.
CYCLOPS: I'm trying, sir.  Sometimes I feel the only reason I'm team leader is because I was your first student.
XAVIER: We all live with doubt, Scott.  How do you think I feel about Henry?  I tried to reach him psionicly, but I failed.  All my wondrous powers and abilities... I still can't help him.
CYCLOPS: But, there wasn't anything you could have done to stop them from taking him either. It wasn't your fault.
XAVIER: Yes.  And, so I've tried to convince myself.  And I forge on.  And so must you.
GYRICH: Once more... where are the X-Men?
BEAST: The way you're treating me... you honestly think we're still on speaking terms?
GYRICH: If you don't want to answer, I could come back after you've had a few hours of this.
BEAST: Look... if I tell you where the X-Men are, it's like I'm doing you a favor.  At this particular juncture I just don't feel you've earned it.  Now, sit me down in front of a nice dinner, a bottle of wine... then we'll talk.  Know what I mean? You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
BEAST (CONT): Actually, could you scratch my back while you're down there... ouch!
GYRICH: You're very entertaining, monkey man. Wise cracking and sailing.  It's cute. Start keeping him under for three minutes.
BEAST: Okay... wait.  Hold on...
GYRICH: You have something to say?
BEAST: Yes, um... could I get a glass of water?
BEAST (CONT): Hey ugly... I want you to think about something.  Do you hurt me because you hate me, or do you hate me because you hurt me?
TORTURER: Shut your mouth, mutie.
TRASK: He's not going to betray his friends.
GYRICH: Let me worry about that.  I'll dig up more guinea pigs.  You just get started on that blood work.
TRASK: You do realize, it doesn't matter how many X-Men we get... the odds of finding the malformations in their genetic structures are still a billion to one.
GYRICH: No, no, no.  Don't try haggling with a mouthful of scientific hoop-de-do.  Your price is set and non-negotiable.
TRASK: I'm only trying to say...
GYRICH: No, no.  You get a hundred thousand for every mutant you create.  Make Uncle Sam an army of mutant super-soldiers, he'll make you a millionaire.  End of story.
XAVIER: Logan... what is it?
LOGAN: I need a favor.
LOGAN: Why does she have to go?
XAVIER: She helps me hold the link.
JEAN GREY: You have to be accepting of this, without reservation.  Otherwise, it won't work.
XAVIER: You will see through my eyes.  We're going to attempt to go beyond your fractured memories, into arenas of unconscious awareness, where things you might once have only been remotely aware of may still exist.  Are you ready?
LOGAN: This is going to sound stupid, but there's this place... with lots of flowers.  Try to find the flowers, alright?
LOGAN (CONT): Okay.  Let's do it.
FADE TO BLACK:
XAVIER: Can you hear me, Logan?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): You're coming in loud and clear, but I can't see anything.
XAVIER: You shouldn't yet.  We're at the edge of a synaptic gap.  We'll have to catch a ride on a neuro-transmitter to leap the breech between your physical mind and your conscious self.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Be gentle.  It's my first time.
JEAN GREY: Here we go...
JEAN GREY: Professor... it's Logan...
OVERLAPPING VOICES (V.O.): Feed... Steady... Cardiotach, Miss Hines?  Rising rapidly, sir.  Maintain...
XAVIER: Do you recognize this place, Logan?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): I've seen it before, but never like this.
JEAN GREY: This is how it happened.  They're bonding the adamantium to his bones.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Yeah, but who are they?
XAVIER: What about the workers?  Do any of them look familiar?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): No... no.  Wait... what about that doctor, over by the tank?
XAVIER: Do you know him?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Nah.  I'm not getting nothing.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): What happened?
XAVIER: We've moved on.  The last memory was too weak to sustain our intrusion.
VOICE FROM RADIO (V.O.): Security at Zone Two... Weapon X has escaped... repeat, emergency...
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): That's me, isn't it?
XAVIER: I'm afraid so.  And, it appears your keepers have lost control of you.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Let's keep moving.  You hear me, Charlie? Move on!
XAVIER: You don't like seeing this side of yourself, do you?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Just, get us out of here.
FADE TO BLACK:
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Where are we?  What is this?
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.,CONT): That's it!  That's the place I see in my dreams.  Can you see it too?
XAVIER (O.S.): Yes.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Well, where is it?  Is there anyone with me there?  Can you show me?
MONOTONOUS VOICE (V.O.): ... are not an animal.  You are a man.  You are not an animal.  You are a man...
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): No... this has got to be wrong.  The flowers were real... I know they were.
XAVIER: I'm sorry, Logan.
LOGAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Damn it!  That's supposed to be my memories?  A bunch of friggin' home movies?
XAVIER: Calm down.
JEAN GREY: Professor...
XAVIER: Do you know these men, Logan?  Logan... can you hear me?
JEAN GREY: What's happening to him?
XAVIER: They must have planted a trigger, to stop him from exploring these memories.
XAVIER (CONT): Get out, Jean.  Go!  Your powers won't work here.  Not as well as mine.
JEAN GREY: Logan, listen.  You have to help him.  If Professor Xavier's consciousness dies in there, he's dead for real.
JEAN GREY: I know you can hear me.  Help him! Fight!
LOGAN: Clear out.  This is between me and me.
XAVIER: You have to kill it.  If you fail...
LOGAN: You don't have to tell me.  I already know what's at stake.
ICEMAN: It's been three hours now.  Shouldn't we at least check on him?
XAVIER: There's no telling what state he'll be in when he comes out... if he comes out.
XAVIER: Logan?
LOGAN: Yeah, it's me.  I still got what few marbles I started with.
XAVIER: We have to get you to the Med Lab.
LOGAN: Med-Lab, Schmed-Lab.  I'm fine.
ICEMAN: Are you sure you're alright?
LOGAN: Man... I need a vacation.
LOGAN: Is this the stuff they wiped away when they botched their brainwashing job?  Or, did the head-shrinkers at Department H give them to me, to keep their Frankenstein monster docile?
XAVIER: It seems probable their forced memories couldn't take root because your mind tried to heal itself, the same way your body heals.  Your mind might still be healing, little by little, day by day.
LOGAN: Or maybe not. Can you go back in?
XAVIER: It's too dangerous.
LOGAN: So, except for finding out my old Secret Service boss helped put the screws to me, I'm right back where I started.
XAVIER: ... to see a marked improvement in this team upon my return.  Will I see such an improvement, Scott?  Can I depend on that?
CYCLOPS: Where there's room for improvement, yes.
GYRICH: Son of a...
BEAST: What?  You're not glad to see me?
MAGNETO: Where are you off to, Sabretooth?
SABRETOOTH: Fie-fi-foe-fan... I smell the blood of an X-Man.
CYCLOPS: Where's Angel?!
LOGAN: I'm checking downstairs.
ICEMAN: They're burning some sort of maps... something about the subway systems.
JEAN GREY: Scott... here!
CYCLOPS: ... oh, Lord... Warren...
CYCLOPS: Hank?
BEAST: In the furry flesh.  What's happened?
CYCLOPS: Warren's hurt.  The Brotherhood got him.
BEAST: How bad is he?
CYCLOPS: We don't know yet.  We have to get him to the infirmary.
JEAN GREY: Thank God you're okay.
ICEMAN: Welcome home, buddy.
BEAST: I'll be right behind you. Charles?
XAVIER: Why would he go in without us?  Did he think he had something to prove?
BEAST: Would you like a moment alone?
XAVIER: I can't tell you how relieved I am to have you back.  I was worried.
BEAST: I'm fine.
XAVIER: They need us in the med-lab.
CAB DRIVER: Are you sure this is where you want?
COP: No food on the trains, tubby.
ATTENDANT: Hey... hey!
ATTENDANT: You see a fat guy go through here? Where'd he go?
ICEMAN: Are you kidding?  You stole a car?
BEAST: Well, I couldn't get a cab, and people tend to stare when I take the bus.
CYCLOPS: Turn over on your stomach, Henry.
LOGAN: I say we head on down to Brooklyn and give the government boys some payback.
CYCLOPS: No time for that.  As soon as we're done here, we're air-mobile.  The Brotherhood's got to figure if we found them once, we might find them again.
ICEMAN: How's Warren?
XAVIER: He'll make it.  But... it's doubtful his wings will be able to heal.
BEAST: What was that?
CYCLOPS: I'm not sure.  Hold still.
LOGAN: Now what?
XAVIER: I set the War Room systems to monitor Manhattan's emergency broadcast system.
SABRETOOTH: Decisions... decisions.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): ... all emergency vehicles... immediately to 59th Street and Fifth Avenue.  This is a eleven-eighty emergency.  Repeating...
ANOTHER OVERLAPPING VOICE (V.O.): ... the hell's going on out there?
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.): You're not going to believe this. Dispatch says the Queensboro Bridge just fell into the East River.
XAVIER: There's an incision here, Henry.  When did they do this?
BEAST: I don't know.  Not while I was awake. Let me see it, Scott.
BEAST: Oh, hell... they set me up.
CYCLOPS: What... ?
BEAST: That's a tracking device.  They wanted me to escape.
GYRICH: Release the Sentinels!
RED SENTINEL: Mutants.
CYCLOPS: Take cover!
BLUE SENTINEL: Divide and conquer.
GREEN SENTINEL: Two mutants down.
GREEN SENTINEL (CONT): Third mutant pending...
RED SENTINEL: Propulsion systems damaged.
BLUE SENTINEL: Mutant.
XAVIER: Here I am!  Come get me.
GYRICH'S VOICE (O.S.): These X-Men are wimps!
GYRICH (CONT): There.  Him.  Make him hit harder.
TRASK: Mister Gyrich, I told you, we only observe.  That's the beauty of it... the Sentinels think for themselves.
XAVIER: Come on... what are you afraid of?
GREEN SENTINEL'S HEAD: Destroy the mutant!
GREEN SENTINEL'S HEAD (CONT): Internal breech.
GREEN SENTINEL'S HEAD (CONT): Malfunction.  Malfunction.  Malfunction...
TRASK: Oops.
GYRICH: Oops?  Oops?!
GYRICH (CONT): Alright, gentlemen... duty calls.  Looks like we're going to have to clean up this spilled milk all by ourselves.
RED SENTINEL: Mutant apprehended.
LOGAN (O.S.): Not so fast, tin man.
RED SENTINEL: Emergency procedures warranted.
CYCLOPS: Close your eyes, Logan!
GYRICH: Are we ready?
TRASK: Gyrich... Gyrich!
GYRICH: What is it?!
TRASK: There's... there's a problem with one of the Sentinels.
GYRICH'S VOICE: That's the beauty of it... Sentinels think for themselves.
CYCLOPS: Thanks.
LOGAN: Same here.
MAGNETO: Welcome, New York City... welcome to the new world order!
MAGNETO'S VOICE (V.O.): Manhattan, in case you hadn't noticed, has been brought to its knees.  Your subways are flooded, your tunnels blocked...
MAGNETO (CONT): Your bridges, from Sixtieth Street to Battery Park, are in ruins.  And, the question issuing from the meek mouth of humankind is, "Why, oh why has this bad fate befallen us?"  Well, let my answer be carried to the ends of the earth.  Because you would not give us a place in your world, we have taken this one small piece. From this day on, the isle of Manhattan no longer belongs to man.  It now belongs to me and to mine.  To mutants.
(over HUB-BUB from:
the assembled PRESS): All those of the human persuasion will be banished, while mutants are welcomed... free to live in peace and solitude, away from baseless discrimination, oppression, and prejudice.  And, just so I am not accused as a squatter or thief, I'm offering the Mayor of New York City full payment in exchange for his splendid little borough.  However, I must admit I haven't exactly accounted for inflation...
MAGNETO (CONT): I'm paying the same price paid to the Manhattan Indians.
MAGNETO'S VOICE (V.O.): To those law enforcement officials gathering outside, and to the ever- scheming leaders of the United States military, I say, keep clear in your memories the limitless power demonstrated this morning.
MAGNETO: Unless you wish to see it wielded again, you'll keep us happy, and keep away.  The only thing we Homo Superior further require from man is the continued supply of water and electricity into our city.
MAGNETO (CONT): Now... thirteen bridges in and above Harlem still stand untouched.  But, in five short days, they too shall fall.  So, citizens of Manhattan, it's time to go.  I must warn you... looters, pillagers, and stragglers will not be tolerated.  And, with that said, let your exodus begin.
XAVIER: How does it feel, Gyrich?  You've just cost hundreds, maybe thousands of lives.
GYRICH: What are you talking about?
XAVIER: If not for your attack, my X-Men might have been there to stop the Brotherhood.
GYRICH: Don't try to push off what a bunch of your murdering mutant friends did, cripple.
XAVIER: Get him out of my sight.
CYCLOPS: Outside with his friends.
ICEMAN: What are we going to do with him?  He knows where we live now.
GYRICH: Don't touch me!
LOGAN: Calm down, sissy-boy.  We're not going to hurt you, no matter how much we'd like to.
GYRICH: Keep away from me.  I'll crawl out of here on my belly before I let you put your hands on me again.
BEAST: I believe he's under the ignorant impression that we're somehow contagious.
CYCLOPS: What a jackass.
LOGAN: The popsicle's right though.  What do we do with Gyrich and his barrel of clowns?
XAVIER: Bring him here.  I know what to do.
GYRICH: Get your hands off me!  Don't touch me...
GYRICH: Don't touch me!
TRASK: Did... did you say something?
GYRICH: What?  What do you mean?
TRASK: I thought you said something.
TROOPER ONE: What's going on?
GYRICH: I... I don't know.  What is this place?
TROOPER: I think it's New Jersey.
GYRICH: What happened to this truck?
TROOPER: Weren't we... going somewhere?
GYRICH: What do you mean?  Where?
TRASK: Gyrich.  Gyrich... where are my Sentinels?
TRASK (CONT): Where are they?  Who stole my robots?
GYRICH: Something weird happened.
TROOPER ONE: Can we go home now?
XAVIER'S VOICE (V.O.): There has been some movement.  As I feared, Magnus' offer is proving to be irresistible to many, despite the bloodshed that facilitated it.
XAVIER'S VOICE (V.O.,CONT): None have reached the city yet, but they are on their way.
MAN ON STREET (V.O.): I say you let all the muties get in there, and then the President drops a nuclear bomb on the place.  That'd solve a lot of problems all at once.
NEWSWOMAN (V.O.): ... at the borders of New Jersey, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, effectively surrounding Manhattan. However, military offensives in the East Village, Tribeca and Times Square have been easily repelled by the Brotherhood...
XAVIER: Governmental policies being what they are, I should have expected mutants to respond to Magnus.  But, I had hoped for better.
CYCLOPS: You've said it before, sir... one battle at a time, to win the war.
LOGAN: Speaking of war, Charlie... how much longer you planning to keep us sitting on the sidelines?
XAVIER: Must we rehash this again?
LOGAN: Yeah, I guess so.  Cause I'm itching, alright?  And, the civilians have cleared out of Manhattan, and the Army-boys and the Marines had their shot and they blew it.  So, what are we waiting for now?
CYCLOPS: Cool down, Logan.
LOGAN: No.  See, you and Jeanie may think every word out of Xavier's mouth is a pearl of wisdom, but to me it's just a lot of hot air lately.
XAVIER: If you feel so strongly, why not go without the others?
LOGAN: I would if I thought I could take the Brotherhood alone.  But, even I'm not quite that talented.
JEAN GREY: Careful there... you almost came right out and said you needed us.
XAVIER: It concerns me that you're so anxious for this fight.
LOGAN: What do you want?  You want to hear that you put my Karma back together so great that I'm just a grinning, happy fellow now?  I'm not going to lie to you. All I'm saying is, the longer it take us to start slamming, the deeper they dig in.
XAVIER: You've made your point. Iceman... go with Jean and Cyclops.  You leave for Manhattan tonight.  Collect Beast from the med-lab.  Tell him I'll be along soon to look after Angel.
LOGAN: That's more like it.
XAVIER: Stay behind a moment, Wolverine.
XAVIER (CONT): It's been a long journey for you to get where you are today.  In many ways I've been proud of you...
LOGAN: Look, I don't need...
XAVIER: Please allow me to finish a sentence without interruption, just this once. Thank you.  As I was saying... you've come far... but not nearly far enough. Before you joined my X-men, they had already faced the Brotherhood and been defeated.  So you see, the status quo would not do.  They lacked experience, which you've helped with.  By introducing them to your peculiar love of violence, you've harden them to a certain extent, and I thank you for that.  However, your services are no longer required.
LOGAN: What?
XAVIER: I'm asking you to leave.  Gather your things with as little disruption as possible, and I'll have your motorcycle brought around front.
LOGAN: You... you can't do this.
XAVIER: What do you mean?  Of course I can.  Is this really so unexpected?  After all, you haven't made much of an attempt to become a part of the team.  I think Scott said it best, when you first arrived... he said, "He's not one of us," ... meaning you. And even though Scott has made a martyr's effort to accept you, it's become increasingly obvious to me that he was right from the start.
XAVIER (CONT): I don't know what else to say. What are you waiting for?  Get out.
XAVIER (CONT): Logan... I've lied to you. Logan, you are an X-Man.  You always will be, till the day you decide otherwise.
LOGAN: What is this?  Just another one of your head games?
XAVIER (CONT): Forget what I said before... but never forget how you felt when I said it. Understand?  Remember how it would feel if you lost everything you've gained... everything you treasure so secretly.
XAVIER (CONT): Go on.  The Brotherhood's waiting.
CYCLOPS: Where's Wolverine?
JEAN GREY: I'll find him.
CYCLOPS: Make it quick.
XAVIER'S VOICE (O.S.): Good evening.
MAGNETO: Charles... what a surprise.  Goodbye...
XAVIER: I'm here in spirit...
XAVIER (CONT): Not in body.
MAGNETO: Clever... though pointless.  You won't mind then if I ignore you.  Your students await their lesson.
XAVIER: You just don't see why I can't let you win this, do you?  Mankind will never let you keep their city.  They fill never stop fighting to reclaim it.
MAGNETO: They'll realize it's futile.
XAVIER: You know the truth.
MAGNETO: Isn't it a bit late in the game... ?
XAVIER: The United States' military-industrial complex needs a war, Eric.  They're starving for one, hot or cold, and you're giving it to them.  Because of you, the Homo-Superior will neatly fill the gap left by the fall of communism.  Mutants will be cast forever as the new world villain.  Is that what you want?
MAGNETO: Nothing is gained without sacrifice.
XAVIER: Turn back.  It's not too late. Don't promise utopia while leading us all to the slaughter.
XAVIER (CONT): Then, it's my turn to pity you.
CYCLOPS: If anyone wants to pray, now's the time.
BEAST: It's ironic we're so close to Wall Street.
ICEMAN: Why's that?
BEAST: Wall Street got its name from the wall that used to keep Indians out of the city.
LOGAN: Well, the cowboys are here.  Where's all the Indians?
JEAN GREY: They're on their way.  I can feel it.
CYCLOPS: Stay awake, everyone.  Here we go.
MAGNETO: X-men.  Children of the Atom.  Surrender now, while you still have your lives.
CYCLOPS: We're fine... thanks anyway.
MAGNETO: It would be so much better if you joined us.  Make my city your homeland, with the Brotherhood as friends.  Otherwise, we have no choice but to kill you, and we don't really want to do that.
SABRETOOTH: Speak for yourself.
LOGAN: Then, what are you waiting for? Let's boogie.
CYCLOPS: We stick together, Wolverine.  Make them bring the battle to us.
MAGNETO: That is easily arranged, Cyclops.
MAGNETO (CONT): Here is your doom!
CYCLOPS: Jean!
MAGNETO: Impressive, Tinkerbell... but not enough.
JEAN GREY: I... I can't hold it much longer.
LOGAN: We got to find a way out of here.
CYCLOPS: Back off.  Clear a space.
JEAN GREY: Scott... hurry!
CYCLOPS: Almost there!
LOGAN: Not good...
ICEMAN: What?
LOGAN: I broke a gas line.
ICEMAN: What do we do now?
LOGAN: Well, if spark hits it, what we do is we fly up in the air about one thousand feet and scream at the top of our lungs. Everybody better start holding their breath real quick!
JEAN GREY: Scott!
BEAST: We're in trouble.
CYCLOPS: We don't have any choice.
ICEMAN: We sure don't.
BLOB: Hooty-hoot!  You got them with your magic. You made them go away.
MAGNETO: Assume nothing, Blob. All of you, spread out.  Eliminate any survivors.  Make them wish they had been lucky enough to have died here.
BEAST: Water sucks.
TOAD'S VOICE (O.S.): Peek-a-boo, I see you!
TOAD: That didn't go quite as planned.
BLOB: Hey... ?!
SABRETOOTH'S VOICE (V.O.): You really don't know when to just lay down and die, do you, Wolverine?
LOGAN: I'm ignorant like that.
SABRETOOTH: It's fine with me.  This way I get to kill you all over again.
SABRETOOTH (CONT): Let's see just how unbreakable them adamantium bones of yours really are.
CYCLOPS: Yes!
CYCLOPS (CONT): No.
BEAST: That's a disgusting habit.
TOAD: Hoo-boy.
JEAN GREY: Hi.
SABRETOOTH: Know what your problem is, shorty?  You're so desperate to get me, you can't see straight.
SABRETOOTH (CONT): You want me dead so bad, you don't care if you go with me...
SABRETOOTH (CONT): And that's when you do something stupid.
LOGAN: ... can't argue with that...
BLOB: Hey... let me out of here!
ICEMAN: Sorry, Blob, no dice.  You know, you look good as a tv dinner.
ICEMAN (CONT): Scott.
BLOB: You're not just going to leave me here like this?  Mister Snowman, please!
JEAN GREY (O.S.): Hank...
JUGGERNAUT: Still breathing, huh?
MAGNETO: Where are your friends?  Are you the sole survivor?  Last of a dying breed.
ICEMAN (O.S.): Not by a long shot.
JEAN GREY: Put him down, Magnus.
MAGNETO: Look there, Cyclops... they came back to save you.  How heart-warming. I'm afraid he doesn't have much to say. He's not feeling well.  But believe me...
MAGNETO (CONT): He's glad to see you.
CYCLOPS: No!
MAGNETO: I'm not finished with you.
JEAN GREY: I told you once already... let him go!!
CYCLOPS: Are you okay?
JEAN GREY: Give me a minute.
CYCLOPS: Stay down then.  I'll be back.
LOGAN: Errrrrrr...
BEAST: Batter, batter, batter, swwwing!
JUGGERNAUT: Your head's going on my trophy wall.
BEAST: Don't count your trophy heads before they're stuffed and mounted.
JUGGERNAUT: See if you can laugh this one off...
ICEMAN: Hit him now, Scott!  Now!
ICEMAN: Now we know why he wore the helmet.  To hide his face.
BEAST: Juggy's not an attractive gentleman. Hey... did you see that?
ICEMAN: What?
BEAST: For a second there, I could have sworn I saw little birds flying around his head.
CYCLOPS: Let's not congratulate ourselves yet, guys.  Magnus is still out there.
MAGNETO: Pious fools.  How dare you...
MAGNETO (CONT): You despoil my paradise!  After all I've done for mutant-kind... for your race! How should such insolence be punished? Death will barely begin to make recompense for the disrespect you've shown me. Perhaps this?  Yes...
MAGNETO (CONT): The girl will be first to die, while you witness her final moments.
LOGAN (O.S.): Witness this, Grandpa!
MAGNETO: You impudent whelp!  I'll rip those metal bones from your body!
CYCLOPS: Give him hell, X-Men!
CYCLOPS: Wolverine.
LOGAN: You're under arrest.
ELDERLY OFFICIAL: What do we tell the world, Mr. President?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): ... members of the Brotherhood have been taken into custody, thanks to the combined effort of the United States intelligence community and the Armed Forces.  Though, government officials expressed regret that they were unable to capture the group of mutant terrorists called "X-Men," who are said to have assisted the Brotherhood in the take over.  There will be a ticker- tape parade in Manhattan today...
CYCLOPS: Not for us.
ICEMAN: Aw... who wants a lousy ticker-tape parade anyway?
ANGEL: I do.
ICEMAN: Yeah, me too.
XAVIER: If I may.
XAVIER (CONT): Word won't truly do justice.  So, all I'll say is this... To you... my family.
LOGAN: Remember, kid.  Might makes right.
ICEMAN: And, the bigger the might...
LOGAN: The bigger the right.
XAVIER: Are you sure we can't convince you to stay, Logan?
LOGAN: Nah.  There is a certain ex-employer of mine up in Canada I'm going to have a chat with.  I'll be back though... someday.
CYCLOPS: Is that a promise?
LOGAN: It's as close as I get to one.
JEAN GREY: Take care.
LOGAN: I will. end
