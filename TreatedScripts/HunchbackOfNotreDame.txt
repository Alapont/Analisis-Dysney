Clopin: MORNING IN PARIS, THE CITY AWAKES TO THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME THE FISHERMAN FISHES, THE BAKERMAN BAKES TO THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME TO THE BIG BELLS AS LOUD AS THE THUNDER TO THE LITTLE BELLS SOFT AS A PSALM AND SOME SAY THE SOUL OF THE CITY'S THE TOLL OF THE BELLS THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME Listen, they're beautiful, no? So many colours of sounds, so many changing moods. Because, you know, they don't ring all by themselves.
Puppet: They don't?!?
Clopin: No, silly boy. Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower, lives the mysterious bell ringer. Who is this creature?
Puppet: Who?
Clopin: What is he?
Puppet: What?
Clopin: How did he come to be there?
Puppet: How?
Clopin: Hush!
Puppet: Ohhh...
Clopin: And Clopin will tell you. It is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster! 
Clopin: DARK WAS THE NIGHT WHEN OUR TALE WAS BEGUN ON THE DOCKS NEAR NOTRE DAME
Gypsy 1: Shut it up, will you!
Gypsy 2: We'll be spotted!
Gypsy Mother: Hush, little one!
Clopin: FOUR FRIGHTENED GYPSIES SLID SILENTLY UNDER THE DOCKS NEAR NOTRE DAME
Boatman: Four gilders for safe passage into Paris.
Clopin: BUT A TRAP HAD BEEN LAID FOR THE GYPSIES AND THEY GAZED UP IN FEAR AND ALARM AT A FIGURE WHOSE CLUTCHES WERE IRON AS MUCH AS THE BELLS
Gypsy: Judge Claude Frollo!
Clopin: THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME JUDGE CLAUDE FROLLO LONGED TO PURGE THE WORLD OF VICE AND SIN AND HE SAW CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE EXCEPT WITHIN.
Frollo: Bring these gypsy vermin to the Palace of Justice.
Guard: You there! What are you hiding!?!
Frollo: Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her.
Clopin: She ran! 
Gypsy Mother: Sanctuary! Please give us sanctuary! 
Frollo: A baby? 
Frollo: A monster! 
Archdeacon: Stop!
Clopin: Cried the archdeacon.
Frollo: This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it back to hell, where it belongs!
Archdeacon: SEE THERE THE INNOCENT BLOOD YOU HAVE SPILT ON THE STEPS OF NOTRE DAME.
Frollo: I am guiltlessshe ran, I pursued.
Archdeacon: NOW YOU WOULD ADD THIS CHILD'S BLOOD TO YOUR GUILT ON THE STEPS OF NOTRE DAME.
Clopin: My conscience is clear!
Archdeacon: YOU CAN LIE TO YOURSELF AND YOUR MINIONS YOU CAN CLAIM THAT YOU HAVEN'T A QUALM BUT YOU NEVER CAN RUN FROM, NOR HIDE WHAT YOU'VE DONE FROM THE EYES THE VERY EYES OF NOTRE DAME!
Clopin: AND FOR ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE OF POWER AND CONTROL FROLLO FELT A TWINGE OF FEAR FOR HIS IMMORTAL SOUL
Frollo: What must I do?
Archdeacon: Care for the child, raise it as your own.
Frollo: What? I'm to be saddled with this misshapen 
Frollo: Very well. Let him live with you, in your church.
Archdeacon: Live here? But where?
Frollo: Anywhere. JUST SO HE'S KEPT LOCKED AWAY WHERE NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE. The bell tower, perhaps. And who knowsour Lord works in mysterious ways. EVEN THIS FOUL CREATURE MAY YET PROVE ONE DAY TO BE OF USE TO ME.
Clopin: And Frollo gave the child a cruel name. A name that means half-formed... Quasimodo! NOW HERE IS A RIDDLE TO GUESS IF YOU CAN SING THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME. WHO IS THE MONSTER AND WHO IS THE MAN? SING THE BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS OF NOTRE DAME! 
Quasimodo: Good morning! 
Quasimodo: Will today be the day? Are you ready to fly? 
Quasimodo: You sure? Good day to try. Why, if I picked a day to fly, oh, this would be it! The Festival of Fools! It will be funthe jugglers, and music, and dancing... 
Quasimodo: Go on! Nobody wants to be cooped up here forever! 
Hugo: Oh, man! I thought he'd never leave! I'll be spittin' feathers for a week!
Victor: Well that's what you get for sleeping with your mouth open.
Hugo: Heh, heh, heh...go scare a nun! Hey, Quasi! What's goin' on out there? A fight? A flogging?
Victor: A festival!
Hugo: You mean the Feast of Fools!?!
Quasimodo: Uh huh!
Hugo: All right, all right! Pour the wine and cut the cheese! 
Victor: It is a treat to watch the colourful pageantry of the simple peasantfolk.
Hugo: Boy, nothin' like balcony seats for watching the ol' F.O.F.
Quasimodo: Yeah, watching. 
Hugo: Hey, looka mime. 
Hugo: Hey, hey, what gives?
Victor: Aren't you going to watch the festival with us?
Hugo: I don't get it.
Victor: Perhaps he's sick!
Laverne: Impossible. If 20 years of listening to you two hasn't made him sick by now, nothing will.
Victor: But watching the Festival of Fools has always been the highlight of the year for Quasimodo.
Laverne: What good is watching the party if you never get to go hear it? Get away from me, go on, you bunch of buzzards! He's not made of stone, like us. 
Laverne: Quasi, what's wrong? You wanna tell ol' Laverne all about it?
Quasimodo: I...I just don't feel like watching the festival, that's all.
Laverne: Well, did you ever think about going there instead?
Victor: Sure!
Quasimodo: I'd never fit in down there. I'm not...normal.
Laverne: Oh, Quasi, Quasi, Quasi. Do you mind? I'm would like to have a moment with the boy, if it's all right with you!
Hugo: Hey, quit beating around the bell tower. Whadda we gotta do? Paint you a fresco?
Victor: As your friends and guardians, we insist you attend the festival.
Quasimodo: Me?!? 
Hugo: No, the Pope. Of course, you! 
Victor: It would be a veritable pope-pourri of educational experience. 
Hugo: Wine, women and song!
Victor: You can learn to identify various regional cheeses!
Hugo: Bobbing for snails!
Victor: And the indigenous folk music.
Hugo: Dunk the monk!
Laverne: Quasi, take it from an old spectator. Life's not a spectator sport. If watchin's all you're gonna do, then you're gonna watch your life go by without you.
Hugo: Yeah, you're human, with the flesh, and the hair, and the navel lint. We're just part of the architecture, right Victor?
Victor: Yet, if you chip us, will we not flake? If you moisten us, do we not grow moist?
Laverne: Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic and a clean pair of hose and
Quasimodo: Thanks for the encouragement, but you're all forgetting one thing.
Gargoyles: What?
Quasimodo: My master, Frollo.
Gargoyles: Oh, yeah, right 
Victor: Well, when he says you're forbidden from ever leaving the bell tower, does he mean "ever ever?"
Quasimodo: Never ever! And he hates the Feast of Fools! He'd be furious if I asked to go.
Hugo: Who says you gotta ask?
Quasimodo: Oh, no.
Hugo: Ya sneak out...
Laverne: It's just one afternoon...
Quasimodo: I couldn't
Hugo: ...and ya sneak back in.
Laverne: He'll never know you were gone.
Quasimodo: I mean, if I got caught
Victor: Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission.
Quasimodo: He might see me.
Hugo: You could wear a disguise. Just this once. What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt you!
Victor: Ignorance is bliss.
Hugo: Look who's talking...
Laverne: Nobody wants to stay cooped up here forever. 
Quasimodo: You're right! I'll go! I'll get cleaned up. I'll stroll down those stairs. I'll march through the doors and 
Frollo: Good morning, Quasimodo.
Quasimodo: Ahum, good...morning, master.
Frollo: Dear boy, whomever are you talking to?
Quasimodo: My...friends.
Frollo: I see. And what are your friends made of, Quasimodo?
Quasimodo: Stone.
Frollo: Can stone talk?
Quasimodo: No, it can't.
Frollo: That's right. You're a smart lad. Now...lunch. 
Frollo: Shall we review your alphabet today?
Quasimodo: Yes, master. I would like that very much.
Frollo: Very well. A?
Quasimodo: Abomination.
Frollo: B?
Quasimodo: Blasphemy.
Frollo: C?
Quasimodo: C-c-c-contrition.
Frollo: D?
Quasimodo: Damnation.
Frollo: E?
Quasimodo: Eternal damnation!
Frollo: Good. F?
Quasimodo: Festival. 
Frollo: Excuse me?
Quasimodo: Forgiveness!
Frollo: You said...festival.
Quasimodo: No!
Frollo: You are thinking about going to the festival.
Quasimodo: It's just that...you go every year.
Frollo: I am a public official. I must go! But I don't enjoy a moment. Thieves and hustlers and the dregs of humankind, all mixed together in a shallow, drunken stupor.
Quasimodo: I didn't mean to upset you, master.
Frollo: Quasimodo, can't you understand? When your heartless mother abandoned you as a child , anyone else would have drowned you. And this my thanks for taking you in and raising you as my son?
Quasimodo: I'm sorry, sir.
Frollo: Oh, my dear Quasimodo, you don't know what it's like out there. I do...I do... THE WORLD IS CRUEL THE WORLD IS WICKED IT'S I ALONE WHOM YOU CAN TRUST IN THIS WHOLE CITY I AM YOUR ONLY FRIEND I WHO KEEP YOU, TEACH YOU, FEED YOU, DRESS YOU I WHO LOOK UPON YOU WITHOUT FEAR HOW CAN I PROTECT YOU, BOY UNLESS YOU ALWAYS STAY IN HERE AWAY IN HERE? YOU ARE DEFORMED
Quasimodo: I AM DEFORMED
Frollo: AND YOU ARE UGLY
Quasimodo: AND I AM UGLY
Frollo: AND THESE ARE CRIMES FOR WHICH THE WORLD SHOWS LITTLE PITY YOU DO NOT COMPREHEND
Quasimodo: YOU ARE MY ONE DEFENDER
Frollo: OUT THERE, THEY'LL REVILE YOU AS A MONSTER
Quasimodo: I AM A MONSTER
Frollo: OUT THERE, THEY WILL HATE WITH SCORN AND JEER
Quasimodo: ONLY A MONSTER
Frollo: WHY INVITE THEIR CALUMNY AND CONSTERNATION? STAY IN HERE, BE FAITHFUL TO ME
Quasimodo: I'M FAITHFUL
Frollo: GRATEFUL TO ME
Quasimodo: I'M GRATEFUL
Frollo: DO AS I SAY. OBEY AND STAY IN HERE.
Quasimodo: I'LL STAY IN HERE. 
Quasimodo: You are good to me, master. I'm sorry.
Frollo: You are forgiven. But, remember, Quasimodo: this is your sanctuary.
Quasimodo: Sanctuary. 
Quasimodo: SAFE BEHIND THESE WINDOWS AND THESE PARAPETS OF STONE GAZING AT THE PEOPLE DOWN BELOW ME ALL MY LIFE I WATCH THEM AS I HIDE UP HERE ALONE HUNGRY FOR THE HISTORIES THEY SHOW ME ALL MY LIFE I MEMORISE THEIR FACES KNOWING THEM AS THEY WILL NEVER KNOW ME ALL MY LIFE I WONDER HOW IT FEELS TO PASS A DAY NOT ABOVE THEM... BUT PART OF THEM... AND OUT THERE, LIVING IN THE SUN GIVE ME ONE DAY OUT THERE ALL I ASK IS ONE, TO HOLD FOREVER OUT THERE, WHERE THEY ALL LIVE UNAWARE WHAT I'D GIVE...WHAT I'D DARE JUST TO LIVE ONE DAY OUT THERE! OUT THERE AMONG THE MILLERS AND THE WEAVERS AND THEIR WIVES THROUGH THE ROOFS AND GABLES I CAN SEE THEM EVERY DAY THEY SHOUT AND SCOLD AND GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES HEEDLESS OF THE GIFT IT IS TO BE THEM IF I WAS IN THEIR SKIN, I'D TREASURE EVERY INSTANT OUT THERE, STROLLING BY THE SEINE TASTE A MORNING OUT THERE LIKE ORDINARY MEN WHO FREELY WALK ABOUT THERE JUST ONE DAY AND THEN I SWEAR I'LL BE CONTENT, WITH MY SHARE WON'T RESENT, WON'T DESPAIR, OLD AND BENT, I WON'T CARE. I'LL HAVE SPENT ONE DAY OUT THERE! 
Phoebus: Huh, ya leave town for a couple of decades and they change everything. 
Phoebus: Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for the Palace of Justice. Would you hmmm, I guess not. 
Woman: Stay away, childthey're gypsies. They'll steal us blind. 
Guard 1: All right, gypsy, where'd ya get the money?
Esmeralda: For your information, I earned it.
Guard 1: Gypsies don't earn money.
Guard 2: You steal it?
Esmeralda: You'd know a lot about stealing!
Guard 1: Troublemaker!
Guard 2: Maybe a day in the stocks will cool you down. 
Phoebus: Achilles! Sit! 
Phoebus: Oh, dear, I'm sorry. Naughty horse, naughty! He's just impossible! Really, I can't take him anywhere.
Guard 1: Get this thing off me!
Guard 2: I'll teach you a lesson, peasant! 
Phoebus: You were saying...Lieutenant? 
Guard 2: Oh, Captain! At your service, sir! 
Phoebus: I know you have a lot on your mind right now, but...the Palace of Justice? 
Phoebus: Come on, boy. Achilles! Heel! 
Frollo: Guard!
Guard: Sir?
Frollo: Ease up. Wait between lashes. Otherwise the older sting will dull him to the new.
Guard: Yes, sir. 
Frollo: Ah, so this is the gallant Captain Phoebus, home from the wars.
Phoebus: Reporting for duty, as ordered, sir.
Frollo: Your service record precedes you, Phoebus. I expect nothing but the best from a war hero of your calibre.
Phoebus: And you shall have it, sir. I guarantee it.
Frollo: Yes. You know, my last captain of the guard was, um, a bit of a disappointment to me. 
Frollo: Well, no matter. I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape.
Phoebus: Uh, thank you, sir, uh, very, uh, tremuh, a tremendous honour, sir.
Frollo: You come to Paris in her darkest hour, Captain. It will take a firm hand to save the weak-minded from being so easily misled.
Phoebus: Misled, sir?
Frollo: Look, Captaingypsies. The gypsies live outside the normal order. Their heathen ways inflame the peoples' lowest instincts, and they must be stopped.
Phoebus: I was summoned from the wars to capture fortune tellers and palm readers?
Frollo: Oh, the real war, Captain, is what you see before you. For twenty years, I have been taking care of the gypsies, one...by...one. 
Frollo: And yet, for all of my success, they have thrived. I believe they have a safe haven, within the walls of this very city. A nest, if you will. They call it the Court of Miracles.
Phoebus: What are we going to do about it, sir? 
Phoebus: You make your point quite vividly, Captain.
Frollo: You know, I like you captain. Shall we? 
Frollo: Oh, duty calls. Have you ever attended a peasant festival, Captain?
Frollo: Not recently, sir.
Frollo: Then this should be quite an education for you. Come along. 
People: COME ONE! COME ALL! LEAVE YOUR LOOMS AND MILKING STOOLS COOP THE HENS AND PEN THE MULES! COME ONE! COME ALL! CLOSE THE CHURCHES AND THE SCHOOLS! IT'S THE DAY FOR BREAKING RULES! COME AND JOIN THE FEAST...OF...

Quasimodo: Master! Master, please! Help me! 
Phoebus: Sir, request permission to stop this cruelty.
Frollo: In just a moment, Captain. A lesson needs to be learned here. 
Esmeralda: Don't be afraid. I'm sorry. This wasn't supposed to happen.
Frollo: You! Gypsy girl! Get down at once!
Esmeralda: Yes, your honour. Just as soon as I free this poor creature.
Frollo: I forbid it! 
Frollo: How dare you defy me!
Esmeralda: You mistreat this poor boy the same way you mistreat my people. You speak of justice, yet you are cruel to those most in need of your help.
Frollo: Silence!
Esmeralda: Justice!
Frollo: Mark my words, gypsy. You will pay for this insolence.
Esmeralda: Then it appears we've crowned the wrong fool. The only fool I see is you!
Frollo: Captain Phoebus! Arrest her. 
Esmeralda: Now, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten of you, and one of me. What's a poor girl to do? 
Frollo: Witchcraft! 
Esmeralda: Oh, boys! Over here! 
Old Prisoner: I'm free, I'm free! 
Old Prisoner: Dang it. 
Phoebus: What a woman! 
Frollo: Find her, Captain! I want her alive!
Phoebus: Yes, sir. Seal off the area, men. Find the gypsy girl, and do not harm her! 
Quasimodo: I'm sorry, master. I will never disobey you again. 
Esmeralda: You! 
Phoebus: Easy, easyI just shaved this morning.
Esmeralda: Oh, really? You missed a spot.
Phoebus: All right, all right. Just calm down. Just give me a chance to apologise.
Esmeralda: For what? 
Phoebus: That, for example.
Esmeralda: You sneaky son of a
Phoebus: Ah, ah, ah! Watch ityou're in a church. 
Esmeralda: Are you always this charming, or am I just lucky? 
Phoebus: Candlelight...privacy... music. Can't think of a better place for hand-to-hand combat! You fight almost as well as a man!
Esmeralda: Funny. I was going to say the same thing about you.
Phoebus: That's hitting a little below the belt, don't you think?
Esmeralda: No. This is. 
Phoebus: Touche! 
Phoebus: I didn't know you had a kid.
Esmeralda: Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers. 
Phoebus: Eh, I noticed. Permit me. I'm Phoebus. It means "sun god." And you are?
Esmeralda: Is this an interrogation?
Phoebus: It's called an introduction.
Esmeralda: You're not arresting me?
Phoebus: Not as long as you're in here. I can't.
Esmeralda: You're not at all like the other soldiers.
Phoebus: Thank you.
Esmeralda: So, if you're not going to arrest me, what do you want?
Phoebus: I'd settle for your name.
Esmeralda: Esmeralda.
Phoebus: It's beautiful. Much better than Phoebus, anyway. 
Frollo: Good work, Captain! Now, arrest her. 
Phoebus: Claim sanctuary. 
Phoebus: Say it!
Esmeralda: You tricked me!
Frollo: I'm waiting, Captain.
Phoebus: I'm sorry, sir. She claims sanctuary. There's nothing I can do.
Frollo: Then drag her outside at 
Archdeacon: Frollo! You will not touch her! Don't worry. Minister Frollo learned years ago to respect the sanctity of the church. 
Frollo: You think you've outwitted me, but I am a patient man, and gypsies don't do well inside stone walls. 
Esmeralda: What are you doing?
Frollo: I was just imagining a rope around that beautiful neck. 
Esmeralda: I know what you were imagining.
Frollo: Such a clever witch. So typical of your kind, to twist the truth to cloud the mind with unholy thoughts. Well, no matter. You've chosen a magnificent prison, but it is a prison nonetheless. Set one foot outside, and you're mine! 
Guard: Frollo's orders! Post a guard at every door. 
Esmeralda: One thing, Djaliif Frollo thinks he can keep us here, he's wrong.
Archdeacon: Don't act rashly, child. You created quite a stir at the festival. It would be unwise to arouse Frollo's anger further.
Esmeralda: You saw what he did out there, letting the crowd torture that poor boy. I thought if just one person could stand up to him, then... What do they have against people who are different, anyway?
Archdeacon: You can't right all the wrongs in this world by yourself.
Esmeralda: No one out there's going to help, that's for sure.
Archdeacon: Perhaps there's someone in here who can. 
Esmeralda: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME OR IF YOU'RE EVEN THERE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO A GYPSY'S PRAYER YES, I KNOW I'M JUST AN OUTCAST I SHOULDN'T SPEAK TO YOU STILL I SEE YOUR FACE AND WONDER WERE YOU ONCE AN OUTCAST TOO? GOD HELP THE OUTCASTS HUNGRY FROM BIRTH SHOW THEM THE MERCY THEY DON'T FIND ON EARTH GOD HELP MY PEOPLE WE LOOK TO YOU STILL GOD HELP THE OUTCASTS, OR NOBODY WILL. 
Parishioners: I ASK FOR WEALTH I ASK FOR FAME I ASK FOR GLORY TO SHINE ON MY NAME I ASK FOR LOVE I CAN POSSESS I ASK FOR GOD AND HIS ANGELS TO BLESS ME! 
Esmeralda: I ASK FOR NOTHING I CAN GET BY BUT I KNOW SO MANY LESS LUCKY THAN I PLEASE HELP MY PEOPLE THE POOR AND DOWNTROD I THOUGHT WE ALL WERE THE CHILDREN OF GOD GOD HELP THE OUTCASTS, CHILDREN OF GOD. 
Man: You! Bell ringer! What are you doing down here!?! 
Man: Haven't you caused enough trouble already? 
Esmeralda: Wait! I want to talk to you. 
Laverne: Look! He's got a friend with him.
Hugo: Yeah, maybe today wasn't a total loss after all.
Victor: A vision of loveliness!
Hugo: The one in the dress ain't bad either. 
Hugo: Quasi!
Victor: Congratulations!
Hugo: Got the girls chasing you already!
Quasimodo: Actually, I
Victor: You mustn't run too fast, or she'll get away!
Quasimodo: Yes, ah, ah, ah, I know. That's what
Hugo: Give her some slack, then reel her in, then give her some slack, then reel her in, then give her some slack
Laverne: Knock it off, Hugoshe's a girl, not a mackerel. 
Esmeralda: Here you are. I was afraid I'd lost you.
Quasimodo: Yes. Um, well, I uh, I have chores to do. It was, uh, nice...seeing...you...again. Ohh...
Esmeralda: No, wait! 
Esmeralda: I'm really sorry about this afternoon. I had no idea who you were. I would never in my life had...pulled...you...up on the...stage. 
Esmeralda: What is this place?
Quasimodo: This is where I live.
Esmeralda: Did you make all these things yourself?
Phoebus: Most of them. 
Esmeralda: This is beautiful. If I could do this, you wouldn't find me dancing in the streets for coins.
Quasimodo: But you're a wonderful dancer.
Esmeralda: Well, it keeps bread on the table, anyway. What's this?
Quasimodo: Oh, no, please oh, I'm not finishedI still have to paint them...
Esmeralda: The blacksmith, and the baker. You're a surprising person, Quasimodo. Not to mention lucky. All this room to yourself.
Quasimodo: Well, it's not just methere's the gargoyles, and of course the bells. Would you like to see them?
Esmeralda: Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali? 
Quasimodo: Follow me. I'll introduce you. 
Esmeralda: Never knew there were so many.
Quasimodo: That's Little Sophia, and... Jean Marie, Ann Marie, and Louise Marie. Triplets, you know.
Esmeralda: And who's this?
Quasimodo: Big Marie. 
Quasimodo: She likes you. Would you like to see more?
Esmeralda: How 'bout it, Djali? 
Esmeralda: We'd love to.
Quasimodo: Good. I've saved the best for last! 
Esmeralda: I bet the king himself doesn't have a view like this! I could stay up here forever.
Quasimodo: You could, you know.
Esmeralda: No, I couldn't.
Quasimodo: Oh, yes, you have sanctuary!
Esmeralda: But not freedom. Gypsies don't do well inside stone walls.
Quasimodo: But you're not like other gypsies. They're...evil.
Esmeralda: Who told you that?
Quasimodo: My master, Frollo. He raised me.
Esmeralda: How could such a cruel man have raised someone like you?
Quasimodo: Cruel?!? Oh, no. He saved my life. He took me in when no one else would. I am a monster, you know.
Esmeralda: He told you that?
Quasimodo: Look at me.
Esmeralda: Give me your hand. 
Quasimodo: Why?
Esmeralda: Just let me see. Hmm, a long life line...oh, and this one means you're shy. Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm...well, that's funny...
Quasimodo: What!
Esmeralda: I don't see any.
Quasimodo: Any what?
Esmeralda: Monster lines. Not a single one. Now you look at me. Do you think I'm evil?
Quasimodo: No, no, no! You are kind, and good, and
Esmeralda: and a gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us. 
Hugo: What did she say?!?
Laverne: Frollo's nose is long, and he wears a truss.
Hugo: Hah! Told ya! Pay up! 
Quasimodo: You helped me. Now I will help you.
Esmeralda: But there's no way out. There's soldiers at every door.
Quasimodo: We won't use a door.
Esmeralda: You mean...climb down?
Quasimodo: Sure. You carry him , I carry you.
Esmeralda: Okay. Come on Djali. 
Quasimodo: Ready?
Esmeralda: Yes.
Quasimodo: Don't be afraid.
Esmeralda: I'm not afraid. 
Esmeralda: Now I'm afraid.
Quasimodo: The trick is not to look down. 
Esmeralda: You've done this before?
Quasimodo: No. 
Esmeralda: Wow. You're quite an acrobat.
Quasimodo: Thank you 
Guard 4: Check the alley!
Guard 5: This way! 
Quasimodo: I hope I didn't scare you.
Esmeralda: Not for an instant. 
Quasimodo: I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.
Esmeralda: Come with me.
Quasimodo: What?!?
Esmeralda: To the Court of Miracles. Leave this place.
Quasimodo: Oh, no. I'm never going back out there again. You saw what happened to me today. No. This is where I belong.
Esmeralda: All right, then I'll come to see you.
Quasimodo: What? Here? But, the soldiers, and Frollo, and...
Esmeralda: I'll come after sunset.
Quasimodo: At sunset, I ring the evening mass, and after that, I clean the kooisters, and then I ring the vespers, and 
Quasimodo: Whatever's good for you. 
Esmeralda: If you ever need sanctuary, this will show you the way.
Quasimodo: But how?
Esmeralda: Just remember: When you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand. 
Quasimodo: Hurry! You must go! 
Phoebus: Hi there. I'm looking for the gypsy girl. Have you seen her? 
Phoebus: Whoa, whoa! Easy!
Quasimodo: No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out!
Phoebus: Wait! All I wanted was to
Quasimodo: Go!
Phoebus: I mean her no harm!
Quasimodo: Go! 
Phoebus: You tell her from me, I didn't mean to trap her here, but it was the only way to save her life. Will you tell her that? Will you?
Quasimodo: If you go. Now!
Esmeralda: I'll go. Now, will you put me down, please? 
Phoebus: Oh. And one more thing. Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.
Quasimodo: Why?
Phoebus: To have a friend like you. 
Hugo: Hey hey! There he is!
Victor: You ejected that tin-plated baboon with great panache!
Hugo: The nerve of him! Snooping around here trying to steal your girl.
Quasimodo: My girl?
Laverne: Esmeralda. Dark hair, works with a goat. Remember?
Hugo: Boy, I do! Way to go, loverboy!
Quasimodo: Loverboy!?! Oh, no, no...
Laverne: Oh, don't be so modest.
Quasimodo: Look. I appreciate what you're all trying to do, but let's not fool ourselves. Ugliest face in all Paris, remember? I don't think I'm her type. SO MANY TIMES OUT THERE I'VE WATCHED A HAPPY PAIR OF LOVERS WALKING IN THE NIGHT. THEY HAD A KIND OF GLOW AROUND THEM IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE HEAVEN'S LIGHT. I KNEW I'D NEVER KNOW THAT WARM AND LOVING GLOW THOUGH I MIGHT WISH WITH ALL MY MIGHT NO FACE AS HIDEOUS AS MY FACE WAS EVER MEANT FOR HEAVEN'S LIGHT BUT SUDDENLY AN ANGEL HAS SMILED AT ME AND KISSED MY CHEEK WITHOUT A TRACE OF FRIGHT I DARE TO DREAM THAT SHE MIGHT EVEN CARE FOR ME AND AS I RING THESE BELLS TONIGHT MY COLD DARK TOWER SEEMS SO BRIGHT I SWEAR IT MUST BE HEAVEN'S LIGHT! 
Frollo: BEATTA MARIA YOU KNOW I AM A RIGHTEOUS MAN OF MY VIRTUE, I AM JUSTLY PROUD BEATTA MARIA YOU KNOW I'M SO MUCH PURER THAN THE COMMON, VULGAR, WEAK, LICENTIOUS CROWD THEN TELL ME, MARIA, WHY I SEE HER DANCING THERE, WHY HER SMOLDERING EYES STILL SCORCH MY SOUL LIKE FIRE, HELLFIRE THIS FIRE IN MY SKIN THIS BURNING DESIRE IS TURNING ME TO SIN! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! I'M NOT TO BLAME! IT IS THE GYPSY GIRL THE WITCH WHO SENT THIS FLAME IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF, IN GOD'S PLAN, HE MADE THE DEVIL SO MUCH STRONGER THAN A MAN! PROTECT ME, MARIA! DON'T LET THIS SIREN CAST HER SPELL DON'T LET HER FIRE SEAR MY FLESH AND BONE DESTROY ESMERALDA AND LET HER TASTE THE FIRES OF HELL OR ELSE LET HER BE MINE AND MINE ALONE! 
Guard 6: Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.
Frollo: What!?!
Guard 6: She's nowhere in the cathedral. She's gone.
Frollo: But how, and...never mind. Get out, you idiot! I'll find her. I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris! HELLFIRE, DARK FIRE NOW GYPSY IT'S YOUR TURN! CHOOSE ME OR YOUR PYRE BE MINE, OR YOU WILL BURN! GOD HAVE MERCY ON HER GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME BUT SHE WILL BE MINE, OR SHE WILL BURN! 
Phoebus: Attention! Morning, sir. 
Phoebus: Are you feeling all right?
Frollo: I had a little trouble with the fireplace.
Phoebus: I see. Your orders, sir?
Frollo: Find the gypsy girl. 
Frollo: Ten pieces of silver for the gypsy Esmeralda. 
Frollo: Lock them up! 
Frollo: Twenty pieces of silver for the gypsy Esmeralda! 
Frollo: Take them away! 
Frollo: We found this gypsy talisman on your property. Have you been harbouring gypsies?
Miller: Our home is always open to the weary traveler. Have mercy, my lord.
Frollo: I am placing you and your family under house arrest until I get to the bottom of this. If what you say is true, you are innocent and you have nothing to fear.
Miller: But we are innocent, I assure you! We know nothing of these gypsies! 
Frollo: Burn it.
Phoebus: What!?!?
Frollo: Until it smolders. These people are traitors and must be made examples of. 
Phoebus: With all due respect, sir, I was not trained to murder the innocent.
Frollo: But you were trained to follow orders. 
Frollo: Insolent coward. 
Frollo: The sentence for insubordination is death. Such a pity you threw away a promising career.
Phoebus: Consider it my highest honour, sir. 
Frollo: Hit him! And don't hit my horse! 
Frollo: Don't waste your arrows. Let the traitor rot in his watery grave! Find the girl! If you have to burn the city to the ground, so be it! 
Guard 7: Sir! We've looked everywhere, and still no sign of the gypsy girl.
Frollo: I had the entire cathedral surrounded, guards at every door. There was no way she could have escaped, unless... 
Laverne: Oh, it doesn't look good.
Victor: It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless. 
Hugo: You're telling me! I'm losing to a bird!
Victor: Oh, that poor gypsy girl. I'm beginning to fear the worst.
Laverne: I know, but, now, don't you say anything to upset Quasimodo. He's worried enough already.
Hugo: Yeah, you're right. We'd better lighten up.
Victor: Shh, shh, shh! Here he comes!
Laverne: Now just stay calm.
Victor: Not a word.
Hugo: Easy does it.
Victor: Stone faced. 
Quasimodo: Any sign of her? 
Victor: Oh, it's a lost cause! She could be anywhere! In the stocks, in the dungeon, on the rack! 
Laverne: Nice work, Victor.
Quasimodo: No, he's right. What are we going to do?
Hugo: What are you guys talking about? If I know Esmeralda, she's three steps ahead of Frollo, and well out of harm's way! 
Quasimodo: Do you really think so?
Hugo: Hey, when things cool off, she'll be back. You'll see.
Quasimodo: What makes you so sure?
Laverne: Because she likes you. We always said you were the cute one.
Hugo: I thought I was the cute one!
Laverne: No, you're the fat, stupid one with the big mouth!
Laverne: What are you saying, exactly?
Laverne: Take it from us, Quasi. You've got nothing to worry about.
Hugo: Yeah, you're irresistible.
Victor: Knights in shining armour certainly aren't her type.
Hugo: And those guys are a dime a dozen. But you? You're one of a kind. Look... PARIS, THE CITY OF LOVERS IS GLOWING THIS EVENING TRUE, THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ON FIRE, BUT STILL, THERE'S L'AMOUR. SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE NIGHT HER HEART IS ALSO ALIGHT AND I KNOW THE GUY SHE JUST MIGHT BE BURNING FOR... A GUY LIKE YOU, SHE'S NEVER KNOWN, KID A GUY LIKE YOU A GIRL DOES NOT MEET EVERY DAY! YOU'VE GOT A LOOK THAT'S ALL YOUR OWN, KID COULD THERE BE TWO? Laverne/Victor:LIKE YOU? 'Goyles: NO WAY!
Hugo: THOSE OTHER GUYS THAT SHE COULD DANGLE ALL LOOK THE SAME FROM EVERY BORING POINT OF VIEW YOU'RE A SURPRISE FROM EVERY ANGLE MON DIEU ABOVE, SHE'S GOTTA LOVE A GUY LIKE YOU!
Victor: A GUY LIKE YOU GETS EXTRA CREDIT BECAUSE, IT'S TRUE, YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN SOMETHING MORE!
Hugo: YOU'RE ACES, KID
Laverne: YOU SEE THAT FACE, YOU DON'T FORGET IT Laverne/Victor:WANT SOMETHING NEW?
Hugo: THAT'S YOU 'Goyles: FOR SURE!
Laverne: WE ALL HAVE GAPED AT SOME ADONIS
Victor: BUT THEN WE CRAVE A MEAL MORE NOURISHING TO CHEW
Hugo: AND SINCE YOU'RE SHAPED LIKE A CROISSANT IS 'Goyles: NO QUESTION OF SHE'S GOTTA LOVE A GUY LIKE YOU! 
Laverne: CALL ME A HOPELESS ROMANTIC BUT QUASI, I FEEL IT
Victor: SHE WANTS YOU SO ANY MOMENT SHE'LL WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR 
Hugo: FOR...
Hugo: A GUY SO SWELL Laverne/Victor: A GUY LIKE YOU WITH ALL YOU BRING HER I TELL YOU, QUASI A FOOL COULD TELL THERE NEVER WAS IT'S WHY SHE FELL ANOTHER, WAS HE? FOR YOU KNOW WHO FROM KING TO SERF TO THE BOURGEOISIE YOU RING THE BELL THEY'RE ALL A SECOND STRINGER 'Goyles: YOU'RE THE BELL RINGER! WHEN SHE WANTS OOH-LA-LA THEN SHE WANTS YOU-LA-LA SHE WILL DISCOVER, GUY, YOU'RE ONE HECK OF A GUY, WHO WOULDN'T LOVE A GUY LIKE YOU?
Hugo: YOU GOT A LOT, THE REST HAVE NOT SO SHE'S GOTTA LOVE A GUY LIKE YOU!
Esmeralda: Quasi? Quasimodo!? 
Quasimodo: Esmeralda?!? Esmeralda! You're all right! I knew you'd come back.
Esmeralda: You've done so much for me already, my friend, but I must ask your help one more time.
Quasimodo: Yes, anything. 
Esmeralda: This is Phoebus. He's wounded, and a fugitive like me. He can't go on much longer. I knew he'd be safe here. Please, can you hide him?
Quasimodo: This way. 
Phoebus: Esmeralda?
Esmeralda: Shh, shh, shh. You'll hide here until you're strong enough to move. 
Phoebus: Great. I could use a drink. 
Phoebus: Ah, yes! Hmmm! Feels like a 1470 burgundy. Not a good year.
Esmeralda: That family owes you their lives. You're either the single bravest soldier I've ever seen, or the craziest.
Phoebus: Ex-soldier, remember? Why is it, whenever we meet, I end up bleeding?
Phoebus: You're lucky. That arrow almost pierced your heart.
Esmeralda: I'm not so sure it didn't. 
Quasimodo: I KNEW I'D NEVER KNOW THAT WARM AND LOVING GLOW THOUGH I MIGHT WISH WITH ALL MY MIGHT NO FACE AS HIDEOUS AS MY FACE WAS EVER MEANT FOR HEAVEN'S LIGHT. 
Quasimodo: Frollo's coming. You must leave. Quick, follow me! Go down the south tower steps.
Esmeralda: Be careful, my friend. Promise you won't let anything happen to him.
Quasimodo: I promise.
Esmeralda: Thank you. 
Laverne: Quick, we gotta stash the stiff! 
Quasimodo: Oh, master, I didn't think you'd be coming
Frollo: I'm never too busy to share a meal with you, dear boy. I brought a little treat. 
Frollo: Is there something troubling you, Quasimodo?
Quasimodo: No. No!
Frollo: Oh, but there is. I know there is. 
Frollo: I think...you're hiding something.
Quasimodo: Oh, no, master. There's nothing
Frollo: You're not eating, boy. 
Quasimodo: It's very good. Thank you. 
Quasimodo: Seeds.
Frollo: What's different in here?
Quasimodo: Nothing, sir.
Frollo: Isn't this one new? It's awfully good. Looks very much like the gypsy girl. I know. You helped her escape!
Quasimodo: But I
Frollo: And now, all Paris is burning because of you!
Quasimodo: She was kind to me, master. 
Frollo: You idiot! That wasn't kindness, it was cunning! She's a gypsy! Gypsies are not capable of real love! Think, boy! Think of your mother! 
Frollo: But what chance could a poor, misshapen child like you have against her heathen treachery? Well, never you mind, Quasimodo. She will be out of our lives soon enough. I will free you from her evil spell. She will torment you no longer.
Quasimodo: What do you mean?
Frollo: I know where her hideout is, and tomorrow, at dawn, I attack with a thousand men. 
Phoebus: We have to find the Court of Miracles, before daybreak. If Frollo gets there first...are you coming with me?
Quasimodo: I can't.
Phoebus: I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.
Quasimodo: Frollo's my master. I can't disobey him again.
Phoebus: She stood up for you. You've got a funny way of showing gratitude. 
Phoebus: Well, I'm not going to sit by and watch Frollo massacre innocent people. You do what you think is right. 
Quasimodo: Look. What am I supposed to do? Go out there and rescue the girl from the jaws of death, and the whole town will cheer like I'm some sort of hero? She already has her knight in shining armour, and it's not me. Frollo was right. Frollo was right about everything. I'm tired of trying to be something I'm not. 
Quasimodo: I must be out of my mind! 
Quasimodo: Phoebus! I'm coming with you!
Phoebus: I'm glad you changed your mind.
Quasimodo: I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for her.
Phoebus: You know where she is?
Quasimodo: No, but she said this would help us find her. 
Phoebus: Good, good, good! Ahhh. Great! What is it?
Quasimodo: I'm not sure.
Phoebus: Hmm. Must be some sort of code. Maybe it's Arabic. No, no, it's not Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek...
Quasimodo: When you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand.
Phoebus: What?
Quasimodo: It's the city!
Phoebus: What are you talking about?
Quasimodo: It's a map! See, here's the cathedral, and the river, and this little...
Phoebus: I've never seen a map that looks like this and... 
Quasimodo: ...and this is it!
Phoebus: ...and this is not it! 
Phoebus: All right, okay. You say it's a map, fine, it's a map. If we're going to find Esmeralda, we have to work together. Truce? 
Quasimodo: Well...okay. 
Quasimodo: Sorry.
Phoebus: No you're not. 
Phoebus: This looks like the symbol on the map.
Quasimodo: But what does it mean?
Phoebus: Hmm. I'm not sure. I can make out an inscription, but it's going to take a few minutes to translate it. 
Phoebus: Yes, well, or we could just go down those stairs. 
Quasimodo: Is this the Court of Miracles?
Phoebus: Offhand, I'd say it's the Court of Ankle Deep Sewage. Must be the old catacombs. 
Phoebus: Cheerful place. Kinda makes you wish you got out more often, eh Quasi?
Quasimodo: Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda and get back to the bell tower. I don't want to get in any more trouble.
Phoebus: Speaking of trouble, we should have run in to some by now.
Quasimodo: What do you mean?
Phoebus: You know, a guard, a booby trap... 
Phoebus: ...or an ambush. 
Clopin: Well, well, well. What have we here?
Skeleton 1: Trespassers!
Skeleton 2: Spies!
Phoebus: We are not spies!
Quasimodo: Can't you listen 
Clopin: Don't interrupt me! You're very clever to have found our hideaway. Unfortunately, you won't live to tell the tale. Clopin/Gypsies:MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF A TERRIBLE PLACE WHERE THE SCOUNDRELS OF PARIS COLLECT IN A LAIR MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT MYTHICAL PLACE CALLED THE COURT OF MIRACLES.
Clopin: HELLO, YOU'RE THERE!
Gypsies: WHERE THE LAME CAN WALK AND THE BLIND CAN SEE
Clopin: BUT THE DEAD DON'T TALK SO YOU WON'T BE AROUND TO REVEAL WHAT YOU'VE FOUND! Clopin/Gypsies:WE HAVE A METHOD FOR SPIES AND INTRUDERS RATHER LIKE HORNETS PROTECTING THEIR HIVE
Clopin: HERE IN THE COURT OF MIRACLES Clopin/Gypsies:WHERE IT'S A MIRACLE IF YOU GET OUT ALIVE! 
Clopin: Gather around, everybody! There's good "noose" tonight! 
Clopin: It's a double header, a couple of Frollo's spies! 
Clopin: And not just any spies! His captain of the guard, and his loyal, bell ringing henchman!
Clopin: JUSTICE IS SWIFT IN THE COURT OF MIRACLES I AM THE LAWYERS AND JUDGE ALL IN ONE WE LIKE TO GET THE TRIAL OVER WITH QUICKLY BECAUSE IT'S THE SENTENCE THAT'S REALLY THE FUN! 
Clopin: Any last words? That's what they all say! NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN ALL THE EVIDENCE
Puppet: WAIT! I OBJECT!
Clopin: OVERRULED!
Puppet: I OBJECT!
Clopin: QUIET!
Puppet: DANG.
Clopin: WE FIND YOU TOTALLY INNOCENT... WHICH IS THE WORST CRIME OF ALL! Clopin/Gypsies:SO YOU'RE GOING TO HANG! 
Esmeralda: Stop! Quasi/Phoebus: Esmeralda!
Esmeralda: These men aren't spiesthey're our friends! 
Clopin: Why didn't they say so!?! Quasi/Phoebus: We did say so!
Esmeralda: This is the soldier that saved the miller's family, and Quasimodo helped me escape the cathedral.
Phoebus: We came to warn you! Frollo's coming! He says he knows where you're hiding, and he's attacking at dawn with a thousand men.
Esmeralda: Then let's waste no time! We must leave immediately! 
Esmeralda: You took a terrible risk coming here. It may not exactly show, but we're grateful. 
Phoebus: Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo. Without his help, I would never have found my way here. 
Frollo: Nor would I! 
Frollo: After twenty years of searching, the Court of Miracles is mine at last. Dear Quasimodo, I always knew you would someday be of use to me.
Esmeralda: What are you talking about?
Frollo: Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
Esmeralda: You're a liar!
Frollo: And look what else I've caught in my netCaptain Phoebus, back from the dead. Another miracle, no doubt. I shall remedy that. There will be a little bonfire in the square tomorrow, and you're all invited to attend. Lock them up.
Quasimodo: No, please, master.
Frollo: Take him back to the bell tower, and make sure he stays there. 
Frollo: The prisoner Esmeralda has been found guilty of the crime of witchcraft. The sentence: death! 
Frollo: The time has come, gypsy. You stand upon the brink of the abyss. Yet even now, it is not too late. I can save you from the flames of this world, and the next. Choose me, or the fire. 
Frollo: The gypsy Esmeralda has refused to recant. This evil witch has put the soul of every citizen of Paris in mortal danger... 
Hugo: Come on, Quasi! Snap out of it!
Victor: Your friends are down there!
Quasimodo: It's all my fault.
Laverne: You gotta break these chains!
Quasimodo: I can't. I tried. What difference would it make?
Victor: But you can't let Frollo win!
Quasimodo: He already has.
Hugo: So, you're giving up? That's it?
Laverne: These chains aren't what's holding you back, Quasimodo.
Quasimodo: Leave me alone. 
Hugo: Okay. Okay, Quasi, we'll leave you alone.
Victor: After all, we're only made of stone. 
Laverne: We just thought maybe you were made of something stronger... 
Frollo: ...for justice, for Paris, and for her own salvation! It is my shameful duty to send this poor girl back where she belongs! 
Quasimodo: No!!!!!! 
Frollo: Quasimodo! 
Quasimodo: Sanctuary!! Sanctuary!! Sanctuary!! 
Frollo: Captain!
Guard 1: Sir?
Frollo: Seize the cathedral! 
Quasimodo: Don't worry. You'll be safe here. 
Frollo: Come back, you cowards! You men! Pick up that beam! Break down the door! 
Phoebus: Alone at last! 
Phoebus: Citizens of Paris! Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city! Now he has declared war on Notre Dame herself! Will we allow it?!?
Crowd: No!!! 
Hugo: I think the cavalry's here!
Quasimodo: Hey! Isn't that
Hugo: Feeble!
Laverne: Doofus!
Quasimodo: Phoebus! 
Victor: Sorry! Sorry! 
Guard: Harder! 
Old Prisoner: I'm free! I'm free! 
Old Prisoner: Dang it! 
Victor: Ready...aim...fire! 
Victor: Are you sure that's how it works? 
Hugo: Works for me! 
Phoebus: Achilles! Sit! 
Laverne: Fly, my pretties! Fly! Fly! 
Guard: Put your backs into it! 
Archdeacon: Frollo, have you gone mad? I will not tolerate this assault on the house of God! 
Frollo: Silence, you old fool! The hunchback and I have unfinished business to attend to. And this time, you will not interfere. 
Quasimodo: We've done it, Esmeralda! We've beaten them back! Come and see! 
Quasimodo: Esmeralda? Wake up! You're safe now. 
Quasimodo: Esmeralda? Oh, no! 
Quasimodo: Oh no. 
Quasimodo: You killed her.
Frollo: It was my duty, horrible as it was. I hope you can forgive me. There, there, Quasimodo, I know it hurts. But now, the time has come to end your suffering. 
Frollo: Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo.
Quasimodo: No, you listen! All my life you have told me the world is a dark, cruel place. But now, I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you! 
Esmeralda: Quasimodo? 
Quasimodo: Esmeralda!
Frollo: She lives! 
Quasimodo: No! 
Frollo: Leaving so soon? 
Guard: Up there! 
Quasimodo: Hang on! 
Frollo: I should have known you'd risk your life to save that gypsy witch. Just as your own mother died trying to save you.
Quasimodo: What!?!
Frollo: Now I'm going to do what I should have done twenty years ago! 
Frollo: And He shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit! 
Esmeralda: Quasimodo! Quasi! 
Esmeralda: No!!! 
Clopin: Three cheers for Quasimodo!! 
Clopin: SO... HERE IS A RIDDLE YOU NEVER CAN GUESS SING THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME! WHAT MAKES A MONSTER, AND WHAT MAKES A MAN? SING THE BELLS, BELLS, BELLS, BELLS... WHATEVER THEIR PITCH, YOU CAN HEAR THEM BEWITCH YOU, THE RICH AND THE RITUAL KNELLS, OF THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME! 
Laverne: Don't you ever migrate?
