High School Musical 2 Script

Setting: May 17-July 5, 2007 East High & Lava Springs Country Club

(In Ms. Darbus Classroom)

Ms. Darbus: Learning is never seasonal, so do allow the shimmering light of summer to refresh and illuminate your fertile young minds. Your future greets you with its magic mirror, reflecting each golden moment, each emboldened choice. So use these incipient summer days and weeks wisely and well��

Troy Bolton: Ms. Darbus has 
snapped her cap

Chad Danforth: Dude, you�re actually listening?

Sharpay Evans: Ryan, this semester of disappointment and humiliation now comes to a screeching halt, and the future begins! And that means��

(Ryan looks at clouds)

Sharpay Evans: Ryan!

Ryan Evans: Is it me, or do those clouds look like Jessica Simpson?

Ms. Darbus: Summers have passed fleetingly since I was your age. Yet, I recall them with poignant clarity, so��

(Jason raises his hand)

Ms. Darbus: Yes, Jason?

Jason Cross: What�s your favorite summer memory, Ms. Darbus?

Everyone: COME ON!!! WHY??!!!

Ms. Darbus: Ah, yes, the Ashland Shakespeare Festival of �88 leaps fondly to mind. In fact��
Chad Danforth: Summer, summer!

Martha Cox and Chad Danforth: Summer, summer!

Kelsi Nielsen: Summer!

Chad Danforth: Summer!

Gabriella Montez: Summer!

Taylor McKessie: Summer!

Sharpay Evans: Summer!

Ryan Evans: Summer!

Zeke Baylor: Summer!

Martha Cox: Summer!

Everyone: SUMMER!! SUMMER! SUMMER! 
SUMMER! SUMMER! SUMMER!

(Bell rings)

(Song: What Time Is It?)

(In the Locker Hallways)

Troy Bolton: Dudes, when hoops camp is done, I�ve got to make bank. I keep hearing my parents talk about what college is going to cost.

Zeke Baylor: Yeah, my folks will match whatever I make this summer, but first I�ve got to get hired.

Chad Danforth: Me, too. I�m saving for a car��

(Taylor McKessie walks in front of Chad Danforth)
Chad Danforth: So I can take that girl on a proper date. Unfortunately, this is my only job skill.

(At Sharpay Evans�s locker)

(Gabriella walks to Sharpay)

Sharpay Evans: I understand you�ve moved every summer for the past five years. I�d hate to think that today is��good-bye?

Gabriella Montez: No worries. My Mom promised I�m here until graduation next year.

Sharpay Evans: Bless mom�s little heart.

Gabriella Montez: Sharpay, we got off to a rough start, but you came through. You helped me with the winter musical.

Sharpay Evans: I did?

Gabriella Montez: Those breathing exercises��

(Does exercise and accidentally pushes Sharpay Evans to locker)

Sharpay Evans: Delighted to assist a fellow Wildcat.

Gabriella Montez: And, actually, I appreciated the opportunity to rest my voice for the spring musical. In which you were excellent!

Sharpay Evans: So they say��

(Gabriella Montez grabs newspaper from Sharpay Evans�s locker)

Gabriella Montez: The second show on the third Friday wasn�t everything it might have been, but the media is so easily impressed.

(In the Locker Hallways with Taylor McKessie, Martha Cox and Kelsi Nielsen)
Taylor McKessie: Gabriella and I have had five job interviews, but we keep getting beat out by college kids.

Martha Cox: Same here. Guess I�m back in the baby-sitting business. Kelsi, what are you planning to do this summer.

Kelsi Nielsen: Grow. Write Music. Grow!

(Everyone laughs)

(At Gabriella Montez�s locker with Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez)

Troy Bolton: Your summer activities consultant has arrived. Me! After basketball camp, we�ll see movies, download music, a little karaoke, and I�m definitely teaching you a twisted flip on the skateboard.

Gabriella Montez: I have Red Cross training, so I can patch myself up afterward.

Troy Bolton: Hey, worse comes to worst, we just chill. As long as we spend summer together, it�s all good.

Gabriella Montez: Promise?

Troy Bolton: Here�s my promise��

(Troy Bolton puts the �T� necklace on Gabriella Montez)

(At Sharpay Evans�s locker with Sharpay Evans and Kelsi Nielsen)

Sharpay Evans: ��going to movies, listening to music��and, golly, Troy, I have Red Cross training so you can teach me skateboarding. What she really needs is new product for her wayward hair. Cheer up, Kelsi, I have a summer job for you. Our rehearsal pianist is evidently moving.

Kelsi Nielsen: (whispers) Or hiding

Sharpay Evans: Pardon?
Kelsi Nielsen: Sounds great!

(Kelsi Nielsen walks away)

Ryan Evans: Relax, Sharpay. It�s summer. You get to do whatever you want. Everything changes.

(Sharpay Evans looks at Troy Bolton, Gabriella Montez, and Kelsi Nielsen walking away)

Ryan Evans: What did I say?

Sharpay Evans: You�re so right, Ryan, after what I�ve been through this semester I deserve a special summer. Ryan, who is the absolute primo boy at East High?

Ryan Evans: I think Troy Bolton has locked up that category, don�t you?

Sharpay Evans: And East High�s primo girl?

(Ryan Evans looks at Kelsi Nielsen)

Sharpay Evans: Just answer the question!

Ryan Evans: Gosh, let me think��You?

Sharpay Evans: Troy��Sharpay. Sharpay��Troy. It just makes sense. 

Ryan Evans: Evidently not to Troy

Sharpay Evans: But it�s summer, Ryan! Everything changes!

(Song: What Time Is It? (Reprise))

(Two weeks later at the Bolton�s house)

Mr. Bolton: What I saw out there just now looks very, very strong, guys. Camp really stepped up your game!
Chad Danforth: What team?

Everyone: Wildcats!

(Troy Bolton�s phone rings)

Chad Danforth: Uh-on, girlfriend alert!

(Troy Bolton answers)

Troy Bolton: Hello?

Mr. Fulton: This is Thomas Fulton over at Lava Springs. I understand you�ve been looking for summer work?

Zeke Baylor: Hey, Troy, does Gabriella still remember your name, or did she karaoke with someone new on vacation?

Troy Bolton: That sounds fantastic, Mr. Fulton. But how did you get my name?

Mr. Fulton: We�ve always had a student summer work program here at Lava Springs. Go Wildcats!

Troy Bolton: Here�s the thing. I know this amazing girl��I mean, student��straight A�s, quintuple straight A�s, and she�s looking for a job, too, and it�d be so amazingly perfect if��

Chad Danforth: Man, he�s really working someone

Mr. Bolton: It can�t be Gabriella. When she calls, he just blushes. I never said that!

(Troy Bolton walks back in)

Chad Danforth: What�s up dog?

Troy Bolton: Up? What? Nothing
(Boys start playing basketball)

Mr. Bolton: Hey, not in the house! Troy�s mother will be home in a minute, then we�re all dead! I�ll tell you what, though, you stick together this summer, work on the game and we�re talking back-to-back championships next fall!

Troy Bolton: Bet on it!

(Everyone tackles each other, Mrs. Bolton comes in)

Mrs. Bolton: Do you think we can all redirect this energy toward carrying the groceries?

Everyone: Yes, Mrs. Bolton!

(Song: You Got It (HSM2 Version))

(Sharpay Evans & Ryan Evans enter club in a pink mustang)

Mr. Fulton: Miss Evans, Mr. Evans��looking very sharp this summer.

Sharpay Evans: Thank you, Fulton. Can you find some shade for our car?

Mr. Fulton: Even if we have to plant a tree, Miss Evans. I trust that your vacation was satisfactory?

Sharpay Evans: New York, for shopping and Broadway shows. Seven days, eight shows, eleven new pairs of shoes. However, it�s good to be��home! Is it possible to get more color in these gardens? I�m thinking yellows and blues!

Mr. Fulton: Lovely!

(Sharpay Evans, Mr. Fulton, and Ryan Evans walk through the hallway, and see a sign said: Lava Springs� Annual Midsummer Night�s Star Dazzle Talent Show! Make Reservations Now!)

Mr. Fulton: This year we embossed the flyers for the show!

Sharpay Evans: Inspired! I plan to limit member talent auditions to thirty seconds each. Amateur performers are very��

Mr. Fulton: Draining? Understood!

Sharpay Evans: And should I��we be so fortunate as to win the Star Dazzle award, again��where would we put it?

Mr. Fulton: We�re planning to widen the trophy case. I have sketches in my office.

Sharpay Evans: You are so efficient! The staffing matter we discussed��?

Mr. Fulton: Handled, with discretion.

Sharpay Evans: How��fabulous!

(At the Lava Springs Pool)

(Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans & Sharpettes walk to their chaises)

Mr. Fulton: Your chaise in its usual spot, Miss Evans?

Sharpay Evans: Wonderful, Fulton! Emma and Jackie west of me, Lea east. And you�ll be a prince to tell the lifeguard to angle our chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.

Mr. Fulton: Thanks to the kind words from your mother last season, he�s been promoted, but I�ll see to it that the new lifeguard is fully briefed on your requirements.

(Mr. Fulton leaves)

Emma: So, what�s the theme of the summer talent show, Sharpay?

Sharpay Evans: Redemption!
Lea: Huh?

Sharpay Evans: It was a very��trying��year, ladies. My drama department was invaded by outsiders��singers coming out of the chemistry lab and locker room.

Ryan Evans: It�s over, Sharpay. It�s summer, remember? We�ve got the pool and the entire club, and the whole summer to enjoy it!

Emma: And the spa has been redone!

Jackie: There�s an avocado facial and seaweed body scrub on the menu!

Lea: It�s all too perfect!

Sharpay Evans: Oh, really? More ice, please!

(Song: Fabulous)

(Troy Bolton and Wildcats enter the club, Troy Bolton looks at Gabriella Montez, Sharpay Evans is shocked, Ryan Evans looks at Kelsi Nielsen as in a trance of love, Sharpay Evans falls in the pool)

(Sharpay Evans screams; Gabriella Montez saves her from drowning)

Sharpay Evans: What are you DOING HERE?

Gabriella Montez: I�m the new lifeguard!

Troy Bolton: Are you a member here?

(In Mr. Fulton�s office)

Sharpay Evans: I asked you to hire Troy Bolton, not the entire East High student body!

Mr. Fulton: Troy Bolton was insistent that Miss Montez have a job. She�s Red Cross certified, you know!
Sharpay Evans: That�s already been clearly pointed out to me!

Mr. Fulton: And Troy was most persuasive on behalf of his teammates. Something about working together, winning together. 

Sharpay Evans: Rah-rah, sis-boom-bah!

Mr. Fulton: You told me whatever it takes to hire Troy Bolton. Well, this is what it took!

Sharpay Evans: Why didn�t you warn me about the rest of them?

Mr. Fulton: I did discuss the matter with the Lava Springs board, of course.

Ryan Evans: The board�you mean, our��

Sharpay Evans: MOTHER!!!

(In Mrs. Evans�s yoga class)

Mrs. Evans: I thought it would be a lovely surprise, my darlings. When Mr. Fulton informed me that Troy Bolton wanted more Wildcats here, I thought, how brilliant!

Sharpay Evans: Brilliant?

Mrs. Evans: Think about the future, kitten! These are chums, not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs members.

Sharpay Evans: These are not my chums! They�ll steal my summer show!

Mrs. Evans: And what fresh talent you�ll have for your Star Dazzle show!

Sharpay Evans: Mother, did you hear what I just said?! Ryan, talk to Mother!

Ryan Evans: Hi, Mom!

Mrs. Evans: Ducky! How�s my dashing boy?
(Ryan Evans and Mrs. Evans do headstands)

Mrs. Evans: Tell pumpkin if she worries to much, she�ll get frown lines.

Ryan Evans: Told her twice!

Sharpay Evans: Oh, namastay!

(Back in Mr. Fulton�s office)

Sharpay Evans: I want them out!

Mr. Fulton: Your mother specifically said��

Sharpay Evans: Don�t mention that backstabbing yogini to me! If you can�t fire them, make them want to quit!

Mr. Fulton: Actually, we do need the help.

Sharpay Evans: Well, if they think working here is going to be summer camp, they�re in for a surprise!

(In the Lava Springs Kitchen with the Wildcats)

Zeke Baylor: Chef Michael is going to teach me the art of Austrian flake pastry, and Sharpay�s going to be where I work. How much better can summer get?

Chad Danforth: (sarcastic) A real dream come true!

Zeke Baylor: If you actually get to know her, she�s��

Chad Danforth: Dude, be my guest!

Troy Bolton: Hey, I had no idea about Sharpay. Mr. Fulton just said there were Wildcat fans at Lava Springs and jobs were available. So let�s go for it!

Mr. Fulton: Indeed, since your jobs will be fleeting if you continue to treat your employment as if it�s recess.

Chad Danforth: Recess? Sir, we�re actually in high school.

Mr. Fulton: As evidenced by the little toy you seem to carry at all times?

Chad Danforth: It�s a basketball, sir!

Mr. Fulton: Better known at Lava Springs as a non-approved recreation device. Confirming assignments, Danforth and Bolton, waiters and, when needed, caddies. Jason and Matt, dishwashers. Miss McKessie, I�m told you�re efficient��You�ll handle member activities. Keep me in sight at all times. Kelsi, piano at lunchtime and cocktail hour. That means mood music, not new music. And you�ll be helping Miss Montez as the assistant water aerobics teacher. She will work with you by the pool at all times. Clear? Martha, chopping, cutting, and preparing plates. Please complete the summer with the equal number of digits that I assume you currently possess. Zeke, you�ll assist Chef Michael in��

Zeke Baylor: The promised land.

Chad Danforth: Um, Mr. Fulton, Your Excellency, sir, is it okay if we draw straws to see who has to wait on Sharpay?

Mr. Fulton: Henceforth, none of you will be waiting on Sharpay

Chad Danforth: Snap!!

Mr. Fulton: You�ll be serving Miss Evans!

Jason Cross: What�s that?

Mr. Fulton: Always address our members as Mr., Mrs., or Miss. Let�s practice. Miss Evans, would you care for lemonade?

Jason Cross: Actually, I�m not Miss Evans, I�m Jason!

(Everyone sighs)

Taylor McKessie: This is going to be a long summer!

Gabriella Montez: Yep!

Kelsi Nielsen: You got that right!

Mr. Fulton: Mr. Danforth, summon your �high school� expertise to demonstrate member protocol for us. Miss��

Chad Danforth: ��Evans��more lemonade��your royal blondness?

Mr. Fulton: Do clock in on time. Three infractions of any kind and your employment is terminated. It would seem your break ended a minute and a half ago, Miss Montez. Let�s hope no members drowned in your absence. 

(Mr. Fulton walks away)

Martha Cox: Okay�� that man officially scares me!

Chad Danforth: Suddenly, I�m missing Ms. Darbus. How sick is that?

Troy Bolton: Guys, there�s a hoop out back, we get two free meals a day, and we only wear geeky outfits when on duty. All for one, one for all. Come on now, it�s our summer!

(Song: Work This Out)

Chad Danforth: What team?

Everyone: Wildcats!

Jason Cross: Does anyone know what �henceforth� means?

Troy Bolton: Ever been on a golf course?

Gabriella Montez: We�re employees, Troy, not members. And I don�t play golf.

Troy Bolton: Who said anything about playing golf?

(On the Lava Springs Golf Course with Gabriella Montez & Troy Bolton)

Gabriella Montez: You sure it�s okay to be out here?

Troy Bolton: Unless the jackrabbits turn us in!

(At the Birdwatch with Sharpay Evans & Ryan Evans)

Sharpay Evans: I have no idea what anyone sees in her!

Ryan Evans: Hard to figure. Since coming to East High, she starred in the winter musical, won the Academic Decathlon, made friends with everyone on campus, and is dating the most popular boy in Albuquerque.

Sharpay Evans: She�s wearing last year�s colors!

Ryan Evans: And picnicking is a nonapproved golf course activity.

Sharpay Evans: I am an outstanding student��if you overlook math, science, social studies, and history. I�m a five-time Star Dazzle winner, have won three �most innovative hairdo� badges from Girl Scouts, and am massively fashion forward. I�ve been at East High three years, and she�s been there five minutes. Isn�t it obvious that Troy Bolton deserves to be with me?

Ryan Evans: Somehow that doesn�t seem like his immediate plan

Sharpay Evans: His plan�s about to change.

(Back on the course with Gabriella Montez & Troy Bolton)

Gabriella Montez: So, how�s kitchen duty?

Troy Bolton: The team that washes dishes together, wins together.
Gabriella Montez: My mom said summer jobs look good on college applications.

Troy Bolton: All part of that frightening concept called �the future�.

Gabriella Montez: You sound a little worried.

Troy Bolton: Hey, college costs a fortune. My parents are saving pennies. Unlike the people at this place.

Gabriella Montez: You�re a cinch for a scholarship.

Troy Bolton: I can�t rely on that. I�m only as good as whatever happens next season.

Gabriella Montez: Let�s decide that the future doesn�t start until September. I�ve never been in one place for an entire summer, Troy, and certainly never with��

Troy Bolton: ��a supremely gifted sandwich maker like me?

Gabriella Montez: I want to remember this summer!

(Back at the birdwatch)

Sharpay Evans: Fulton, Sharpay Evans here. When I was on the fourth fairway today, it seemed��bone dry! Could you give it a little extra splash?

Mr. Fulton: Right away, Miss Evans!

(Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez about to kiss, sprinklers come on, they frolic around the course)

(Back to Birdwatch)

Ryan Evans: That sort of looks like fun.

Sharpay Evans: Does it?
(Back at the course)

(Mr. Fulton comes on the course)

Mr. Fulton: This is a private club, not a water park! We exist to serve our membership. Employees will do well to remember their place. Clear? Late back from your break today, now frolicking on the golf course. We�re not off to an auspicious start, Miss Montez.

(Back at the Birdwatch)

Sharpay Evans: Keep an eye on them tomorrow and keep me posted.

Ryan Evans: Why are you smiling? You�re scaring me now.

Sharpay Evans: There�s nothing to worry about, Ryan. This is our campus, remember?

(The next day in the Piano Room with Gabriella Montez, Troy Bolton and Kelsi Nielsen)

Gabriella Montez: Whoa, sounding good, Wildcat!

Kelsi Nielsen: Actually, I have to get ready for the ladies� bridge luncheon. I won�t exactly be rocking out. But we�ll all really have fun in the club�s talent show, because employees do a number and I�ve got ideas for everyone��You guys can sing lead, and Zeke and Chad and everyone can do backup and maybe dance, too, and��

(Behind a plant with Ryan Evans)

Ryan Evans: Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square. We may have trouble.

(Back at Piano Room)

Troy Bolton: Club talent show? Whoa, whoa! Big time-out on that one. My singing career began and ended with the East High Winter Musical. I�m only here to make a check and sneak into the pool after work.
Kelsi Nielsen: Oh.

Gabriella Montez: What was that piece you were playing a minute ago?

Kelsi Nielsen: Oh��nothing. It�s really just��nothing!

Gabriella Montez: What�s this about?

Kelsi Nielsen: I was thinking if you guys did a show next year at school��you know��I wanted to be ready.

(Back at the Plant)

Ryan Evans: (speaking in walkie-talkie) You want the bad news or the good news?

Sharpay Evans: Just spill it, Ryan! I�m busy!

Ryan Evans: I heard Kelsi working on an amazing new song, and she didn�t write it for us! But the good news is that Troy announced that he doesn�t want anything to do with our Star Dazzle Show!

(Back to the Piano)

Gabriella Montez: Well, can we at least hear the song you�re working on? It does have our name on it��

(Song: You Are the Music in Me)

(All the Wildcats come in)

Gabriella Montez: Wow, I love that song!

Taylor McKessie: I�ve got the talent show sign-up sheet right here. The kitchen staff said it�s really fun. How about it?

Troy Bolton: Well, I guess we could croak something out if we had to. But, it�s got to be all of us!
(Everyone gives High- Fives)

(In the Avocado Facial Room with Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans and Mrs. Evans)

Sharpay Evans: I�ve been thinking, Ryan, it might actually be a wonderful idea if Troy participates in our show!

Ryan Evans: But if he sings with Gabriella, our talent show is going to be��

Sharpay Evans: Oh, I�m not certain Gabriella is ideally suited to help Troy realize his full potential here at Lava Springs. Mommy, what time is Daddy going to be here?

Mrs. Evans: We tee off at noon. Join us?

Sharpay Evans: Love to!

(In the Kitchen with everyone)

(Mr. Fulton comes in)

Mr. Fulton: Danforth, Bolton, you�re caddying today. Forty bucks a bag. You�ve been requested.

Troy Bolton: By who?

Chad Danforth: Who cares? For forty bucks, I�d caddy for Godzilla!

Mr. Fulton: That�s the spirit!

(On the Golf Course with Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans, Mrs. Evans, Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth)

Sharpay Evans: Hi, boys! So, Troy, I thought it was time for you to meet my parents!

Troy Bolton: Meeting the parents?

Mrs. Evans: Ashonte!

Troy Bolton: Where�s your dad?

(A helicopter appears)

(Mr. Evans comes out of it)

Mr. Evans: Where�s the first tee and what�s the course record? Just kidding��I built the course myself and hold the record, but who�s counting? So, quite a season you boys had.

Sharpay Evans: Troy played for the golf team, too, Daddy!

Mr. Evans: Versatile! What about you, son?

Chad Danforth: Baseball, Track & Field

Mrs. Evans: Might come in handy today, with the way I play golf. Fair warning!

(Everyone backs-up, Mrs. Evans makes a big swing)

(On the next hole)

Troy Bolton: One forty-three to the pin, downhill lie, elevated green. I�d go with the seven iron, sir!

(Mr. Evans swings far)

Mr. Evans: Nice call, son!

Sharpay Evans: GO TROY!!!

(Next hole)

(Sharpay Evans swings almost hits Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth in the head)
Chad Danforth: Why don�t you take up knitting, Sharpay? That way you can only injure yourself!

(At the pool with Troy Bolton & Gabriella Montez)

Troy Bolton: Dinner tonight? Then sneak a swim?

Gabriella Montez: Yes!

(Back on the course with Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans, Troy Bolton, Chad Danforth, Mr. Evans, and Mrs. Evans)

Sharpay Evans: Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?

(Troy Bolton swings far)

(Troy Bolton gets carried away in Sharpay Evans�s golf cart)

Chad Danforth: I�m saving up for a car, saving up for a car!

(Troy Bolton swings again at next hole)

Mrs. Evans: Tiger Woods would have been proud to make that shot!

Sharpay Evans: Absolutely, and what a shame that a potential all-star for the University of Albuquerque Redhawks is busing dishes in the kitchen?

Mr. Evans: They�ve got Troy working in the kitchen? I�ve seen Troy play basketball. And I�m sure the Redhawks will be interested in his future!

Sharpay Evans: That�s inspired, Daddy! Troy is very concerned about college!

(In the Kitchen with the Wildcats)

Chad Danforth: Next time I see Country Club Princess, I�m launching her and her pink cart straight into the pool!

Mr. Fulton: Mr. Danforth, this is a kitchen, not a nail salon! You and Jason suit up for lunch duty in the dining room. Bolton, you�ve got five minutes to change and come with me.

(Mr. Fulton and Troy Bolton leave)

Taylor McKessie: What�s with the tie and coat?

Jason Cross: Maybe it�s a country club version of detention!

(In the Dining Room with Mr. Evans, Mrs. Evans, Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans, and Troy Bolton)

Mr. Evans: Let�s talk about your future, Troy!

Troy Bolton: My��future?

Sharpay Evans: Daddy�s on the board of directors at the University of Albuquerque!

Mr. Evans: Yep, we�ve got plenty to talk about, but first�� (Looks at Chad Danforth & Jason Cross) ��Bring on the food!

(Chad Danforth and Jason Cross come in)

(In The Kitchen)

Martha Cox: What are they doing to him?

Zeke Baylor: Who knows, but that pancetta-wrapped foie gras with seared bay scallops looks amazing!

Kelsi Nielsen: Look, Troy�s trying to figure out which fork to use!

Taylor McKessie: Problem solved!

(In the Dining Room)

Mr. Evans: I saw your championship game. Wow, the shot at the buzzer��

Troy Bolton: My teammates stole the ball, or I wouldn�t even have had the chance to��

Sharpay Evans: Oh, Troy, you�re much too modest! You were voted MVP for the entire season! This shirt positively screams for a Windsor knot!

Troy Bolton: A what?

(Back in Kitchen)

Gabriella Montez: What�s she doing?

Kelsi Nielsen: Fixing his tie.

Taylor McKessie: Or strangling him!

(Chad Danforth and Jason Cross come in the Kitchen) 

Gabriella Montez: What are they all talking about?

Chad Danforth: How Troy single-handedly saved the planet!

(Back in Dining room)

Mr. Evans: We�ve got a heck of a basketball program at U. of A., and an excellent scholarship program!

Troy Bolton: Scholarship?

Mr. Evans: Between the bunch of us here, we pull a little weight at the school. And it�s never too soon to be thinking about your future, son.

Troy Bolton: Oh, man, I�m supposed to clock out. Mr. Fulton��

Mr. Evans: Nonsense! You haven�t had dessert, and we haven�t talked golf!

Sharpay Evans: Basketball and golf are just beginning with Troy, Daddy, have you heard him sing?

Troy Bolton: Singing? No, no��

Mr. Evans: A singing point guard? Now this I gotta hear!

Sharpay Evans: Maybe at our Star Dazzle Talent show! Oh, give them a sample, Troy!

Troy Bolton: My voice is a little hoarse, today. But, thank you so much for the golf and food. It�s all been��great!

Sharpay Evans: So��you will sing some other time, though, with me. Promise?

(Troy Bolton sighs, Mr. and Mrs. Evans look at Troy Bolton sternly)

Troy Bolton: Of course.

(At the pool with Troy Bolton & Gabriella Montez)

Troy Bolton: Sorry I�m late! Just give me a few more minutes!

Gabriella Montez: Nice tie. Shoes don�t match, though!

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(Taylor McKessie comes in)

Taylor McKessie: Honey, ten minutes is being late��but an hour is approaching a felony! 

Gabriella Montez: We just talked about having dinner. No big deal!

Taylor McKessie: Just because Troy is a nice guy, doesn�t mean he�s immune to boy disease!

Gabriella Montez: Boy disease?

Taylor McKessie: Forgetting things he shouldn�t forget.

Gabriella Montez: So now you�re a boy expert?

Taylor McKessie: My older sister has ten rules about boy behavior, and nine involve boys forgetting things they shouldn�t forget, like dinner dates.

Gabriella Montez: It wasn�t an official date type of thing.

Taylor McKessie: Rule three: All dates are official, whether the boy knows it or not. Chad and I are going for pizza with Zeke, Matt and Jason. I think Martha and Kelsi are going to meet us. So let�s go��

Gabriella Montez: I�ll meet you there. Troy will probably want to come, too.

(In the kitchen with Troy Bolton & Mr. Fulton)

Mr. Fulton: Don�t clock out, Bolton.

Troy Bolton: But I�m done for the day, sir

Mr. Fulton: Evidently not. Your presence is required in the ballroom

(In the Ballroom with Troy Bolton)

(Troy Bolton sits in chair)

Troy Bolton: What the heck?

Kelsi Nielsen: Hi, Troy!

Troy Bolton: Kelsi! What are you doing here?

Kelsi Nielsen: Same reason as you!

(Ryan Evans, Sharpay Evans and the Sharpettes appear on the stage)
(Song: Humuhumunukunukuapua�a)

(Ryan Evans and Kelsi Nielsen leave)

Sharpay Evans: So? You love it?

Troy Bolton: Look, do you ever just��sing? Without lights, sets, and all the backup people?

Sharpay Evans: It would be much harder to get applause that way.

Troy Bolton: I�m not talking about applause��or volcanoes, I�m talking about hanging with friends, doing nothing, and singing for fun!

Sharpay Evans: Wait a minute, not doing anything��that might work! A dark stage, a single spotlight. We break out of darkness into the circle of light��

Troy Bolton: We?

Sharpay Evans: No set, no frills. Just you and me. Simple, dramatic. That�s a wonderful idea, Troy! We could do it in our club talent show!

Troy Bolton: I�m here to work. Saving money for my��future! Being onstage is really your thing, not mine!

Sharpay Evans: It could be��our thing!

Troy Bolton: What?! Whoa. I�ve already got an �our thing� with Gabriella, which I�m very late for at the moment!

Sharpay Evans: But the show could be so��

Troy Evans: Hey, those are really nice shoes you�re wearing!

Sharpay Evans: You like them?

Troy Bolton: I really do!

Sharpay Evans: I bought them in New York. I have them in nine colors.

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(At the Pool with Gabriella Montez)

(Troy Bolton runs in)

Troy Bolton: CANNONBALL!

(Troy Bolton jumps in pool)

Gabriella Montez: Whoa, you�re crazy, Wildcat!

Troy Bolton: And so late, but I have food, a candle for a poolside picnic, and Zeke made desserts. But first, I dare you��

Gabriella Montez: I�ve got to go take my jacket off!

Troy Bolton: What happened to Miss Fun Kindergarten?

Gabriella Montez: CANNONBALL!

(Gabriella Montez jumps in pool)

Troy Bolton: Hey, you have no idea what I just saw. I�ll never be able to look at a pineapple again. 

Gabriella Montez: Huh?

Troy Bolton: Never mind. You know, right now with you, it�s finally feeling like summer.

Gabriella Montez: Yeah, it is.

(Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez about to kiss, but Mr. Fulton interrupts them)

Mr. Fulton: Well, well, the water bugs are back!

Troy Bolton: It was my idea, Mr. Fulton, she didn�t��

Mr. Fulton: You have a reason to be here after-hours, Mr. Bolton. Miss Montez, however, does not. I overlooked the tardiness yesterday. But then came the golf-course jaunt, and now this. Two days, two strikes. Don�t get a third. Out of the pool!

(At the Bolton�s house with Troy Bolton and Mr. Bolton)

Troy Bolton: Sharpay�s dad let me play a few holes today. Then he introduced me to some U. of A. alumni in the dining room.

Mr. Bolton: What alumni?

Troy Bolton: Mr. Sherwood, Mr. Langdon. They�re members at Lava Springs.

Mr. Bolton: I played ball with those guys. I�ll give them a call. This is great news!

Troy Bolton: Really?

Mr. Bolton: Shaking hands with influential alumni doesn�t hurt.

Troy Bolton: But they were talking about scholarships right in front of Jason and Chad, who were like��serving food to me.

Mr. Bolton: And getting paid for it. It�s called a job. You were invited nothing wrong with that.

Troy Bolton: It felt weird.

Mr. Bolton: I love that you�ve got the team working together at the club, but senior year is coming up, Troy. You�re not going to be a Wildcat forever. Team is about now, but everyone has their own future. 

Troy Bolton: I�m not sure what you mean
Mr. Bolton: As life goes on, lots of dogs are chasing the same bones. But one dog gets there first. You�ve earned your opportunities, son. A scholarship is special because they don�t give it to everyone��
Troy: I get it, Dad.

Mr. Bolton: Okay. So��how was the food at Lava Springs?

Troy Bolton: Insanely good!

(At the Pool for Water Aerobics class with Gabriella Montez and Kelsi Nielsen)

(Troy Bolton runs in)

Troy Bolton: Still haven�t gotten all the water out of my ears. Didn�t mean to get you in trouble.

Gabriella Montez: And vice versa.

Troy Bolton: So maybe today we can��

(Sharpay Evans comes in)

Sharpay Evans: Oh, Troy?

(Sharpay Evans holds a sign saying Mr. Fulton�s Office)

Troy Bolton: Anyway, what time is your lunch break?

Sharpay Evans: TROY!!

(Sharpay Evans still holds sign)

Gabriella Montez: One-thirty

Troy Bolton: The free cheeseburgers are on me. See you then?

Gabriella Montez: Yes!
(Taylor McKessie comes over to see Kelsi Nielsen and Gabriella Montez)

Taylor McKessie: What�s that girl up to?

Gabriella Montez: Who knows?

Kelsi Nielsen: Believe me, she does!

(In the Kitchen with Troy Bolton and Mr. Fulton)

Troy Bolton: I�m sorry I�m a couple of minutes late. Mr. Fulton. And the pool thing last night, you can�t blame Gabriella, she only��

Mr. Fulton: I�m promoting you!

Troy Bolton: You are?

Mr. Fulton: There�s an opening as an assistant to the golf pros. Salaried job, no clocking in. You start immediately.

Troy Bolton: But��

Mr. Fulton: Five hundred dollars per week.

Troy Bolton: WHAT!! Per week?! Oh, man, that�s totally off the hook! I mean��that sounds very��workable.

(Troy Bolton and Mr. Fulton leave)

(In Men�s Locker Room for Members Only with Troy Bolton and Mr. Fulton)

Troy Bolton: I�ll be teaching golf?

Mr. Fulton: To kids. Oh, the joy.

Troy Bolton: I don�t think I�m qualified!

Mr. Fulton: Show the little angels which end of the club to hold, tee up a ball, then duck. There�s more. The board is extending membership privileges to you for the summer. You have full use of club facilities. So be prudent, and��

(Mr. Fulton opens Troy Bolton�s locker)

Mr. Fulton: ��congratulations!

Troy Bolton: Whoa!

Mr. Fulton: Save it for the first tee. And to get there, this might come in handy!

(Gives Troy Bolton a key)

Mr. Fulton: That�s for your golf cart. It�s number fourteen. Same as your basketball uniform, I�m told. Questions?

Troy Bolton: How did this happen?

Mr. Fulton: Evidently, Sharpay Evans feels you have untapped potential. Young man, the future is a big place, and the Evans family has real clout. I suggest you take the ride.

(At the Pool with Sharpay Evans, Sharpettes, Gabriella Montez, Kelsi Nielsen & Ryan Evans)

Sharpay Evans: Is the green piping too much?

Emma: Green is so this year!

Sharpay Evans: (speaking loud so that Gabriella Montez and Kelsi Nielsen can hear) I�m taking a golf lesson from Troy Bolton, so I want to look just right!

Sharpettes: Ahh!!! Troy is a hottie! 

(Gabriella Montez goes with Chad Danforth to get supplies for lunch)
Sharpay Evans: (to Kelsi Nielsen) The pool has never looked better! Brava!

(Sharpay Evans and the Sharpettes leave)

(On the golf course with Troy Bolton and Mr. Fulton)

Mr. Fulton: Bolton, your eleven-thirty is here.

(Mr. Fulton leaves)

(Sharpay Evans runs to Troy Bolton)

(Back at the pool with Kelsi Nielsen and Ryan Evans )

Ryan Evans: If you ever decide to dump my sister into the pool, give me a warning so that I can be here.

Kelsi Nielsen: Does she ever actually swim, or just look at the pool all summer?

Ryan Evans: Sharpay doesn�t allow her hair near water without shampoo, conditioner, and blow dryer within reach. Look��um��I just want to say that I think it�s cool that you�re here. Last year�s assistant water aerobics teacher was fat and had a hairy back.

Kelsi Nielsen: I guess that�s a compliment.

Ryan Evans: Oh, absolutely. I mean, entirely!

Kelsi Nielsen: It was fun watching you in the spring show, Ryan. Especially when Sharpay wasn�t dancing in front of you. You were amazing.

Ryan Evans: Really?

Kelsi Nielsen: Like, big-time! I�m looking forward to seeing you in the club talent show!

Ryan Evans: Okay, well��thanks again. I mean, not for what you just said about my dancing, but for just being here. By the pool. On a nice day and everything. I guess they pay you to do that, right?
(Ryan & Kelsi about to kiss, Kelsi stops the kiss)

Ryan Evans: I guess I�ll swim now. I�m not that good a swimmer, but�� aerobics teacher who can swim on duty��

Kelsi Nielsen: Ryan? You want to put on a swimsuit.

Ryan Evans: Point taken!

(On the Golf Course with Sharpay Evans and Troy Bolton)

Sharpay Evans : By the end of summer you�ll have me playing like a pro!

(Sharpay Evans swings badly)

Troy Bolton: If I live that long.

Sharpay Evans: I�m so excited about the Star Dazzle Talent Show. We�ll find something great to do.

Troy Bolton: I already told you that�s not for me.

Sharpay Evans: Here�s the best news: all the Redhawk coaches and the whole scholarship committee will be there!

Troy Bolton: Really?

(Taylor McKessie comes in and watches them from a distance)

Sharpay Evans: Of course! Daddy and Mommy are on the University of Albuquerque�s booster board. We�ll lock up your scholarship with a high C right from center stage. We�re all in this together, right?

Troy Bolton: Your family is being very nice, Sharpay, but singing with you isn�t part of my job.
Sharpay Evans: I know! It�s just something you promised to do. Remember?

(Troy Bolton sighs)

Sharpay Evans: You look fabulous in your new clothes, by the way!

Troy Bolton: You like the shoes? They�re Italian!

(Sharpay Evans and Troy Bolton laugh)

(Taylor McKessie gets upset)

(Gabriella Montez & Chad Danforth come over to Taylor McKessie)

Taylor McKessie: That girl has more moves than an octopus in a wrestling match!

Chad Danforth: I don�t see him running away.

Gabriella Montez: Troy can handle himself.

Taylor McKessie: Think so? He�s asking her for her opinion on his new �Italian� golf shoes

Gabriella Montez: He didn�t ask me.

Taylor McKessie: So wake up, sister. Sharpay is basically offering him a college education just to sing with her in the talent show.

Chad Danforth: He�ll never do that!

Taylor McKessie: You got eyes? Use �em!

(Gabriella Montez & Chad Danforth leave)

(Back on the course with Troy Bolton and Sharpay Evans)

(Mr. Fulton comes in)

Mr. Fulton: Mr. Bolton, Mr. Evans wants you in the lobby, immediately!

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(Sharpay Evans swings ball perfectly, Taylor McKessie in shock!)

(In the Lobby with Mr. Evans and Troy Bolton)

Mr. Evans: Troy Bolton, this is��

Troy Bolton: I�ve seen them all play at U. of A.

Mr. Evans: Come scrimmage up at their gym tonight!

Troy Bolton: Play��with them?

Mr. Evans: You�re in, bro!

Troy Bolton: Wow! That�s awesome!

Mr. Evans: Excellent! Now, let�s all get some awesome lunch!

(Sharpay Evans appears with a coral blue tie)

Sharpay Evans: I knew it! Coral blue! It�s perfect for your skin tones! And mine, too! We�re majorly skin tone compatible, Troy! 

Troy Bolton: I have no idea what that means!

Sharpay Evans: You don�t need to! I�m here for you!

(In the Dining Room with Chad Danforth, Troy Bolton, Sharpay Evans, Mr. Evans, Mr. Fulton, and Redhawks)

(Chad Danforth brings a cheeseburger for Troy Bolton)

Troy Bolton: Actually, I think I asked for Swiss on the burger.
Chad Danforth: What?

Mr. Fulton: Table three needs for iced tea, Mr. Danforth.

(Chad Danforth walks to kitchen)

(In Kitchen with Taylor McKessie & Gabriella Montez)

(Chad Danforth sits with them)

Chad Danforth: You were right! There�s a guy out there who looks just like Troy, but I don�t who he really is.

(In the Piano Room with Kelsi Nielsen, Ryan Evans & Sharpay Evans)

Ryan Evans: Hey, Kelsi�s got great ideas to spark up the show. She��

Sharpay Evans: I�m thrilled! That duet you were playing the other morning for Troy and Gabriella, I�m told it�s very good. I need it!

Kelsi Nielsen: Actually, that�s not available!

Sharpay Evans: Repeat?

Kelsi Nielsen: It�s something I wrote for Troy and Gabriella. In case they��

Sharpay Evans: You�re an employee, here, not a fairy godmother!

(Kelsi Nielsen gives Sharpay Evans the music)

Sharpay Evans: Transpose the key. Troy and I will be doing it in the talent show.

(Ryan Evans gets mad)

Sharpay Evans: And brighten up the tempo a little bit. We�ll need to keep people awake after the other member acts!

(Kelsi Nielsen gasps)

Ryan Evans: What about Humuhumunukunukuapua�a?

Sharpay Evans: Change in plans!

Ryan Evans: What am I supposed to do with my tiki warrior outfit?

Sharpay Evans: Save it for Halloween, go to a luau, sell it on eBay, I don�t know! But, in the meantime, keep an eye on those Wildcats. If they�re planning on being in the talent show��which I doubt, once they hear about Troy and me��I don�t want any surprises! And I�ll find a song for you somewhere in the show. Or the next show!

Ryan Evans: Really? Don�t strain yourself, slick!

(Ryan Evans leaves)

Sharpay Evans: Entertainers are so��temperamental!

(At the basketball hoop behind the kitchen with Troy Bolton)

(Gabriella Montez walks in)

Gabriella Montez: Look at you! Go team!

Troy Bolton: It�s a gift from the guys!

Gabriella Montez: The �guys�. Oh, you mean all those tall people?

Troy Bolton: Right, the Redhawks. I�ve got to go in a minute, but I�ll be back in an hour or so. Then can we go see a movie? Promise?

Gabriella Montez: �Promise� is a very big word, Troy

Troy Bolton: I know��

Gabriella Montez: And we�ve got the staff softball game tonight. Remember, you �promised� that you�d play?

Troy Bolton: Right��softball��tonight. I�ll absolutely meet you there!

Gabriella Montez: You forgot, didn�t you?

Troy Bolton: No, I just got the days mixed up. I�m really sorry about missing lunch today, too. It�s been wild! I can�t believe how things are working out here!

Gabriella Montez: Italian golf shoes, new clothes, golf carts. That�s crazy stuff. Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.

Troy Bolton: That�s just for my job!

Gabriella Montez: Right��the future. That�s all I used to worry about, too. Never took my nose out of a book. Then, I came to East High, lifted my head up and liked what I saw. It�s easy to lose that, I think.

(Chad Danforth, Zeke Baylor & Jason Cross appear)

Chad Danforth: Let�s see if the Tiger Woods of Toon Town still has a jump shot!

(Redhawks appear to pick up Troy Bolton)

Zeke Baylor: Hey, tell them to come over here and mix it up. We�ll give �em some game.

Troy Bolton: I don�t think that�s how they roll.

Chad Danforth: That�s not how they �roll�? You think you�re on ESPN or something?

Troy Bolton: We�re going to be working out with their coaching staff, I meant.

Chad Danforth: Gee, you think maybe you can get us a video?

(Troy Bolton�s about to leave)

Zeke Baylor: Yesterday, you said we had a two-on-two for after work, before the softball game.

Chad Danforth: Zeke, that was so yesterday. You know, when we were all a team! Yo, Bolton��that�s my ball!

(Troy Bolton leaves with Redhawks)

Jason Cross: Will you guys be mad if I ask him to get me one of those cool Redhawk jackets?

Chad Danforth: What?

(Chad Danforth, Jason Cross, Zeke Baylor & Gabriella Montez leave to softball game)

(In the parking lot with Kelsi Nielsen, Taylor McKessie and Gabriella Montez on Taylor McKessie�s golf cart)

Kelsi Nielsen: Hey, Wildcat, no rehearsal tonight?

Ryan Evans: My sister is working up something new for the talent show. Without me!

Gabriella Montez: So, you know about the staff softball game tonight?

Ryan Evans: I�m not staff!

Kelsi Nielsen: And I�m not much of a softball player. So, let�s go!

(Ryan Evans gets in the cart)

Kelsi Nielsen: Hey, since you are not doing anything with Sharpay, I thought you can sing this duet song.
Ryan Evans: �Nothing�s Gonna Stop Us Now�? But, who am I going to sing it with?

Kelsi Nielsen: Me! If you don�t mind.

Ryan Evans: Oh, no, it�s okay! But, it�s for six people!

Kelsi Nielsen: Me and you will sing lead, Martha, Jason, Chad, Taylor and Matt will join! Maybe Gabriella, too.

Ryan Evans : Well, okay. I�ll do it!

(At the softball game with Chad Danforth, Ryan Evans, Kelsi Nielsen, Taylor McKessie, Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats)

Chad Danforth: Did Fulton send you out here to spy on us?

Ryan Evans: Nah! My sister did.

Chad Danforth: What?

Ryan Evans: She thinks you guys might upstage her talent show.

Zeke Baylor: No worries! We talked about doing the show, but it looks like Troy has bailed on us. So, whatever.

Gabriella Montez: What do you mean �whatever�?

Kelsi Nielsen: It�s our summer, remember. I thought we decided doing the show would be fun?

Martha Cox: I think so!

Taylor McKessie: Me, too!

Chad Danforth: Who are we kidding? We don�t know what we�re doing!

Kelsi Nielsen: (pointing at Ryan) He does! If we had a real director putting it together, we could be great! Have the employees ever won the Star Dazzle award?

Ryan Evans: Hey now��

Kelsi Nielsen: I know what you can do, Ryan. So why not do it for us?

Chad Danforth: Look, if you want to hang, grab a mitt and let�s play ball. But we�re not dancers, so let�s get on with the game!

Ryan Evans: You don�t think dancing takes some game?

(Song: I Don�t Dance)

Chad Danforth: Evans, I�m not saying I�m going to dance in the show, but if I did�� what would we do?

(Ryan Evans & Kelsi Nielsen smile)

(At the University of Albuquerque Gymnasium with Troy Bolton, Mr. Evans, Mr. Bolton and the Redhawks)

(Troy Bolton plays ball with Redhawks)

Mr. Evans: I like what I�m seeing!

Mr. Bolton: Troy gives one hundred and ten, twenty-four seven. That you can count on!

Mr. Evans: Have him work on that step-back move. He�s got to be able to shoot over the tall dudes.

Mr. Bolton: I grew four inches in college. But we�ll be working on the step-back, believe me.

(At the pool with Kelsi Nielsen)

(Ryan Evans comes in)

Ryan Evans: Looking, good!

Kelsi Nielsen: Wow, wildcat!

Ryan Evans: Too much?

Kelsi Nielsen: Um, only in daylight, but the East High colors, really impressive!

Ryan Evans: Yeah! Be true to your school, right?

Kelsi Nielsen: Right, everyone is excited about doing the show

Ryan Evans: Hey, I know that everyone thinks that I�m Sharpay�s poodle, but I really think that�

Kelsi Nielsen: Hey, if you think they are thinking that, they�re not thinking that today. But, how do you do that swing-step?

Ryan Evans: Oh, well, you put your back on the other person�s chest, look into their eyes, and then move your head closer and�� (Almost kiss, Troy Bolton comes in)

Troy Bolton: Kelsi!

Kelsi Nielsen: Hey!

Ryan Evans: Hey!

Troy Bolton: Try to call you, Kelsi, so you can get Gabriella. Got hung up at the gym.

Ryan Evans: My dad said you did real well with the college guys.

Troy Bolton: Yeah!

Kelsi Nielsen: See ya around, Ryan?

(Ryan Evans kisses her hand)

Ryan Evans: Promise! Meet me at the golf course for lunch?

Kelsi Nielsen: Bet on It!

(Mr. Fulton arrives)

Mr. Fulton: Pool not quite ready, Miss Nielsen? We open in five minutes! Mr. Bolton, I think you�re due on the golf course.

(In the kitchen with the Wildcats)

(Troy Bolton walks in)

Zeke Baylor: Hey, how�d it go with the Redhawks?

Troy Bolton: They�re very��tall!

Zeke Baylor: We got Vince from maintenance to play. So it worked out.

Troy Bolton: Maybe we�ll play later today.

Chad Danforth: Check with Vince.

Troy Bolton: Mr. Evans set up the workout, not me.

Chad Danforth: You ask to include us? Or maybe you ran out of room on your �to-do� list.

Troy Bolton: I didn�t go looking for the Redhawks, they came to me. I didn�t sign up for this golf job; Fulton offered it. But I said yes. My choice. Because it�s fun, and it�s stuff I should be doing for my future. I show up to work, same as you!

Chad Danforth: Oh, please, if you get a speck of dirt on your pants, someone dry cleans you. You order off the menu, we eat what�s left!

Troy Bolton: You�d be doing the same thing, if��

Chad Danforth: ��if we were as good as you?

Troy Bolton: I didn�t say that!

Chad Danforth: We voted you captain of the Wildcats not because you�ve got a good jump shot, but because you�re the guy who�s supposed to know what�s up! That was before the summer, though, wasn�t it?

Troy Bolton: You think you�ve got me all figure out? I don�t think so!

(Mr. Fulton enters)

Mr. Fulton: Gentlemen, you�re not being paid to play Dr. Phil. Recess is over! Get busy! 

(Mr. Fulton turns to Troy Bolton)

Mr. Fulton: Bolton, Mr. Evans wants you to meet him over at Indian Hills Country Club to golf with a couple of his business partners. He left you the keys to his Ferrari.

(Mr. Fulton gives keys to Troy Bolton and they both leave)

Jason Cross: Ferrari? All right, I admit it. Troy�s a superior being!

Chad Danforth: Yeah, just ask him!

(At the Rehearsal stage with Sharpay Evans, Troy Bolton, Sharpettes, Kelsi Nielsen, Taylor McKessie & Mrs. Evans)

Sharpay Evans: (to Troy Bolton) Daddy will make certain the entire scholarship committee is right here. Perfect view!

Mrs. Evans: (to Troy Bolton) And I�ve invited your parents as our guest. It�ll be a fabulous evening!

(In a tent with Kelsi Nielsen & Taylor McKessie)

Kelsi Nielsen: Good thing there isn�t a panel of judges!

Taylor McKessie: My sister�s boy rule number seven: when boys mess up��they really go all out!

(Song: You Are the Music in Me (Sharpay Version))

Sharpay Evans: You know, Troy, I�ve always known you were special. And it�s pretty obvious that I�m special. I think we were meant to sing together, don�t you? I�m so excited for your future, it�s just all worked out like a dream come true!

(Troy Bolton imagines Sharpay Evans in wedding dress)

Sharpay Evans: Troy?

Troy Bolton: I need some air!

(Troy Bolton walks away)

Sharpay Evans: Don�t be long! We need to run it again!

(In the Rehearsal Room with Ryan Evans, Kelsi Nielsen, Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats)

(Everyone leaves)

Kelsi Nielsen: Thank you, Ryan!

Ryan Evans: Thank you!

(Ryan Evans kisses Kelsi Nielsen�s hand)

(Kelsi Nielsen leaves)

(Sharpay Evans enters)

Sharpay Evans: I said keep an eye on them, not turn them into the cast of Grease!

Ryan Evans: Pretty cool, huh?

Sharpay Evans: What are you doing to my show?! Do you want me to lose the Star Dazzle award to a bunch of��dishwashers?

Ryan Evans: Your show? I�m part of a different show, remember?

Sharpay Evans: What with you and Kelsi, huh?

Ryan Evans: We�re in love, sue us!

(Sharpay Evans looks scared)

Sharpay Evans: When did you become��one of them?

Ryan Evans: Hey, that�s a compliment! But you and Troy have a good show, sis!

Sharpay Evans: Oh, we plan to!

(In Fulton�s Office with Mr. Fulton)

(Sharpay Evans enters)

Sharpay Evans: The Midsummer Night�s Star Dazzle means something to me, and to my family! Those Wildcats will turn it into one big farce!

Mr. Fulton: Your brother is one of �those Wildcats�, I�m told.

Sharpay Evans: Don�t mention that traitor to me!

Mr. Fulton: Employee involvement in the Star Dazzle show is tradition.
Sharpay Evans: Traditions change! My parents have important guest coming. We�ll need every employee on duty that night, and not on the stage!

Mr. Fulton: You might want to think this one out.

Sharpay Evans: All right. Done! Now do it!

(Sharpay Evans leaves)

(Mr. Fulton looks in a mirror)

Mr. Fulton: What are you looking at?

(The next day by the pool)

(Mr. Fulton appears with Taylor McKessie)

Mr. Fulton: Distribute these in the staff area, but not until end of shift.

Taylor McKessie: Of course! 

(Mr. Fulton gives Taylor McKessie the flyers)

(Taylor McKessie reads memo)

Taylor McKessie: What?! What! But��

Mr. Fulton: No discussion, Miss McKessie! This is a business. I�m sorry to be the one to tell you, but welcome to the world of adults who have jobs they wish to keep because they have mortgages they wish to pay��tuition bills, car payments, etc. So sometimes there are tasks, however unpleasant, required by employers in order for the aforementioned and all-important paycheck to arrive in your all-too-empty pockets!

Taylor McKessie: May I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Fulton?

Mr. Fulton: That would be lovely, thank you!

(In the Kitchen with all the Wildcats, except for Troy Bolton)

Martha Cox: How are we supposed to do a show if we�ve got a full shift?

Taylor McKessie: I think that�s the point! Nothing we can do, Fulton�s orders.

Chad Danforth: No way this is Fulton�s idea.

Kelsi Nielsen: Unless Fulton suddenly has blond hair and wears designer dresses!

(Gabriella Montez and Kelsi Nielsen leave to the pool)

(At the Pool with Sharpay Evans & Kelsi Nielsen)

Kelsi Nielsen: Why are you doing this to Ryan?

Sharpay Evans: Your boyfriend? He�s just using you, so you can make his act better than mine.

Kelsi Nielsen: Stop lying!

Sharpay Evans: If you don�t leave right now, I promise you, they won�t find you in the morning

(Taylor McKessie come in and watches from a distance)

Kelsi Nielsen: You know what, I�ll tell Fulton to tell your parents about this and they will make sure that you won�t perform

Sharpay Evans: GIRLS!!

(Sharpettes come in and grab Kelsi Nielsen)

Sharpay Evans: Take her to the Birdwatch and make sure that you lock all the doors!

(Sharpettes take Kelsi Nielsen away)
(Taylor McKessie runs away)

(Gabriella Montez comes)

Gabriella Montez: Forget about the rest of us, how about he fact that your brother has worked incredibly hard on this show?

Sharpay Evans: Oh, boo-hoo. He�ll be in the show. He�s a member. And don�t lecture me about Ryan, given the way you�ve been interfering with Troy�s future!

Gabriella Montez: What?

Sharpay Evans: You�ve gotten him written up by Mr. Fulton for sneaking onto the golf course, swimming after hours��I had to step in just to save Troy�s job. He is worried about the future, worried about college, and all I�ve tried to do is help!

Gabriella Montez: What�s that got to do with messing with our show?

Sharpay Evans: You recruited Ryan because you�re jealous of what I�ve done for Troy!

Gabriella Montez: I�m not talking about Troy! I�m talking about my friends, your brother, my summer!

Sharpay Evans: Oh, please, you don�t like the fact that I won!

Gabriella Montez: What�s the prize? Troy? The Star Dazzle award? You have to go through all this to get either one? No thanks, Sharpay. Your club, your world, and you�re welcome to it. But just step away from the mirror long enough to see who gets hurt when you win!

(Sharpay Evans walks away)

(Gabriella Montez stays there)

(In the Kitchen with Taylor McKessie and Ryan Evans)

Taylor McKessie: If I have to teach one more class, I�m going to need a paddle!

Ryan Evans: Might not be a bad idea!

(Troy Bolton comes in)

Troy Bolton: Oh, man��this is messed up!

Taylor McKessie: Like you didn�t see it coming?

Troy Bolton: What�s that supposed to mean?

Taylor McKessie: It�s pretty obvious that big stage is just for you and your new best friend, Sharpay!

Ryan Evans: Hey, Taylor �� everyone, especially Kelsi, is going to Red Robin for cheeseburgers and Cheesy French fries. You want to come?

Taylor McKessie: Yeah! Hold on. And I�m sure that not everyone will be there.

Ryan Evans: What do you mean?

Troy Bolton: Does Gabriella think that�s what I want?

Taylor McKessie: Boyfriend rule number ten: wake up and smell the coffee, dude!

Troy Bolton: Where is she?

Taylor McKessie: Don�t know. She told us this is her last day at Lava Springs.

Troy Bolton: What?

(Troy runs off to stop her)

Ryan Evans: So, what do you mean?

Taylor McKessie: Sharpay took Kelsi. Her posse has locked her up in the Birdwatch.

Ryan Evans: What?!! I�m going to save her.

Taylor McKessie: Ya think?

(Taylor McKessie heads to Red Robin and Ryan Evans leaves)

(At the Pool with Gabriella Montez & Troy Bolton)

Troy Bolton: You can�t leave.

Gabriella Montez: Us working together sounded good, Troy, but things change. Right?

Troy Bolton: So, give me a chance to make them change again!

Gabriella Montez: The talent show is a huge deal for Sharpay. It�s a big deal for your future, too. That�s cool.

Troy Bolton: The golf, the singing, I�m just trying to work out this scholarship thing.

Gabriella Montez: Except when I talk to you, I don�t know who I�m talking to anymore.

Troy Bolton: It�s me!

Gabriella Montez: Blowing off your friends, missing dates? If that�s you, it�s good to know!

Troy Bolton: I just need to get through this show!



Gabriella Montez: All I know is if you act like someone you�re not, then pretty soon that�s who you become! When I said I haven�t had a summer in one place for five years, that was the truth! I want it to be special, and this isn�t the place for that to happen.

Troy Bolton: I meant what I said about movies, skateboarding, and being together.

Gabriella Montez: I�m sure you did, at the time.

Troy Bolton: I�m just trying to catch up with it all. 

Gabriella Montez: Me, too. Because summer�s happening, and I�m going to go find it. But I�ll see you in September, Troy.

(Song: Gotta Go My Own Way)

(At the Bolton�s home in Troy�s bedroom with Troy Bolton)

(Mr. Bolton walks in)

Mr. Bolton: Usually you�re taking these right off the grill! (holding a plate of ribs)

Troy Bolton: Maybe I�ve been eating too much at the club.

Mr. Bolton: Thought you�d be inviting the guys over for these ribs. I bought a couple extra slabs.

Troy Bolton: Do you think I seem real��different to you, dad?

Mr. Bolton: You dress a lot better than usual. What�s up?

Troy Bolton: Gabriella is quitting because she thinks I�m going overboard working the scholarship thing. I�m just doing the show with Sharpay because she�s hooked me up with the boosters and all that. I don�t really care about the golf, and playing with the Redhawks is cool but not if my guys don�t even want to come over here and play hoops anymore!
Mr. Bolton: Whoa��whoa! Troy, I hope you�re only doing that talent show because you want to do it.

Troy Bolton: I get it that hanging with Mr. Evans and the boosters are a really big deal for my future!

Mr. Bolton: I got carried away talking up and shaking hands at Lava Springs. But whatever college turns out to be right for you, scholarship or not, we�ll make it work as a family. We�ve got your back, Troy!

Troy Bolton: Yeah?

Mr. Bolton: Bet on it! Here�s my only rule about the future: wherever you go, just make sure you don�t leave yourself behind.

(The next day in kitchen with the Wildcats, except for Gabriella Montez)

(Troy Bolton walks in)

(No one talks, Kelsi Nielsen give memo to Troy Bolton)

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(On the golf course with Troy Bolton)

(Song: Bet On It)

(At the Montez residence with Gabriella Montez)

(Troy Bolton comes in and throws rocks at Gabriella�s window)

Gabriella Montez: Troy? What are you doing here?

Troy Bolton: I came to tell you to come back!

Gabriella Montez: Never in a million years!

Troy Bolton: Come on!
Gabriella Montez: No!

(At the Birdwatch with Kelsi Nielsen)

(Ryan Evans comes in)

Ryan Evans: Kelsi! Are you okay?

Kelsi Nielsen: Yeah. But hurry, Sharpay and her posse might find you.

(Song: Without Love)

(At Montez residence with Troy Bolton & Gabriella Montez)

Gabriella Montez: Troy, I still want to be with you, but I just can�t handle it at that club. See you in September.

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(The next day at Lava Springs Stage with Sharpay Evans, Troy Bolton and the Sharpettes)

Sharpay Evans: (screaming) WHAT?!!!! What do you mean you�re not doing the show?

Troy Bolton: That�s exactly it!

Sharpay Evans: We�re singing a duet, Troy! A duet means two people! Mostly me in this came, but whatever! Duet!

Troy Bolton: I�m an employee, and there aren�t any employees in the show.

Sharpay Evans: You�re an honorary member!

Troy Bolton: Was! Fulton gave my kitchen job back! The memo said they�re shorthanded on staff for the show.

Sharpay Evans: Listen to me! There�s too much at stake for you tonight! An entire table of university boosters are all coming to see you! Thanks to me!

Troy Bolton: Too bad they�re going to miss Ryan & the Wildcats. That�s worth seeing!

Sharpay Evans: They�re not messing up my show!

Troy Bolton: Then neither am I!

Sharpay Evans: But you parents are coming, too!

Troy Bolton: I�ll be their waiter. They�ll be thrilled!

(Troy Bolton leaves)

(At the Midsummer Night�s Star Dazzle Award Talent Show with Mr. Fulton and Sharpay Evans)

Mr. Fulton: I cannot order Mr. Bolton to sing! That�s not part of his job description! However, as you know, Ryan has a theatrical background, and he can hit a high C, if asked��

Sharpay Evans: I don�t need a high C! I need divine intervention! We have three hundred people arriving! I thought I told Lea to find Ryan!

(Ryan Evans appears)

Ryan Evans: She did. Here I am.

Sharpay Evans: Thank goodness! Warm up the volcano. Humuhumunukunukuapua�a is back in.

Ryan Evans: Enjoy your pineapple on your own, Sharpay. I�m not doing the show.

Sharpay Evans: What?! Get our costume on!

Ryan Evans: I took your advice. I sold it on eBay! Oh, and I�m singing a different act with Kelsi, my new girlfriend, and the other Wildcats!

(In the Kitchen with Ryan Evans, Kelsi Nielsen, Chad Danforth & Wildcats)

(Troy Bolton walks in)

Chad Danforth: Kelsi told us what went down between you and Sharpay.

Troy Bolton: I�m sorry I messed up your show!

Zeke Baylor: Yeah, and show business is our entire lives!

(Everyone gives hugs)

Troy Bolton: I know I�ve been acting pretty weird. I�m hoping you haven�t permanently filled my slot in the two-on-two game. And, Ryan, I know you put a lot of work in with these guys��so I apologize.

(Ryan Evans shakes hands with Troy Bolton; Kelsi Nielsen gives Ryan Evans a hug)

Chad Danforth: We think you should sing tonight.

Troy Bolton: What? I already made up my mind!

Ryan Evans: All those people are out there. You�re good. And I don�t really want to see my sister crash and burn. At least, I think I don�t. (looks at Zeke) By the way, I hope you hid that pastry cart because when Sharpay gets nervous, she eats.

(Backstage in Sharpay Evans�s Room with Sharpay Evans and Mr. Fulton)

Mr. Fulton: I don�t want to tell you how to produce your show, but the first three acts haven�t exactly lit the house on fire.


Sharpay Evans: I�m ruined! My life is over! I�ve been a good girl. I�ve never lied, except when necessary. I�ve always bought my parents expensive gifts��using their credit card, of course. But I don�t deserve this humiliation!

Mr. Fulton: At the very least, you�d better get out there and sing. It�s either you or Mrs. Hoffenfeffer and her talking sock puppet!

Sharpay Evans: Take me now, God!

Mr. Fulton: I think I remember my old soft shoe. I�ll give it a try. But you better warm up those vocal cords.

(Mr. Fulton leaves)

Sharpay Evans: What would Madonna do in this situation? Okay, forget that!

(Troy Bolton enters)

Troy Bolton: How�s your show going?

Sharpay Evans: How�s it going? My show makes the captain of the Titanic look like he won the lottery.

Troy Bolton: I�ll sing with you, Sharpay.

Sharpay Evans: What?

Troy Bolton: I did promise to sing with you, and I keep my promises. But what was that thing you said to me when I first started working here?

Sharpay Evans: Bring me an iced tea?

Troy Bolton: Think harder. We�re��

Sharpay Evans: ��all in this together.

Troy Evans: Yeah, that.
Sharpay Evans: Well�� we are, so let�s get out there and knock �em dead, Troy Bolton!

Troy Bolton: But not just you and me, Sharpay. The Wildcats, too. I do the show��if the Wildcats do the show. Or do you just want to sit here and polish off what�s left of the pastry cart?

Sharpay Evans: I just sort of wish you were doing this��for me. You�re a good guy, Troy��Actually, right now, I think I like you better than I like myself. Did I say that? 

(In the Kitchen with the Wildcats)

(Troy Bolton enters)

Ryan Evans: Sharpay wants you to do a different song. Work it out and practice. Kelsi and I will stall by singing a song with Martha, Matt, Jason, Zeke, and others, good luck!

Troy Bolton: What? But��

Ryan Evans: Just go with it!

Troy Bolton: Where�s Chad and Taylor?

(Everyone leaves to the stage)

(Jason Cross and Martha Cox come)

Jason Cross: (to Troy Bolton) Hey, dude, I like Martha Cox!

Troy Bolton: AWESOME!!

Martha Cox: He�s very sweet!

(At the Montez residence with Gabriella Montez)

(Chad Danforth and Taylor McKessie appear in her room)
Gabriella Montez: What are you��?

Chad Danforth: Yell at us in the car!

Gabriella Montez: Why aren�t you working?

Taylor McKessie: We are!

Gabriella Montez: I�m not going back to the club!

Taylor McKessie: Explain that to Ryan! Our show�s back in, and he said nothing will work without you. Trust me, he�s right!

(At the Talent Show with Mr. Bolton and Mrs. Bolton)

Mr. Bolton: What do you think?

Mrs. Bolton: Well��it�s nothing I�ve ever seen before!

Mr. Bolton: Keep smiling!

Mrs. Bolton: That�s the easy part!

(On the stage with Mr. Fulton)

Mr. Fulton: And now, ladies and gentlemen, I�ve been handed a change in the program. I�m not quite sure what to expect, but, as they say, the show must go on. So, without further a do, we present Ryan Evans singing this year with assistant water aerobics teacher and piano player, Kelsi Nielsen.

(Song: Nothing�s Gonna Stop Us Now)

(Kelsi Nielsen, Ryan Evans and the Wildcats run off stage)

(Backstage with Troy Bolton, Sharpay Evans, Sharpettes and Ryan Evans)

Troy Bolton: Why�d you switch songs? I don�t know if I can pull this off!

Sharpay Evans: Switched songs? WHAT?

Troy Bolton: Yeah, Ryan said��

(Mr. Fulton grabs Troy Bolton and leaves)

Sharpay Evans: How am I supposed to get through this? I don�t know this song!

Ryan Evans: I know!

(Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans & Sharpettes leave)

(Onstage with Troy Bolton)

Mr. Fulton: So, here�s our assistant golf pro, Mr. Troy Bolton��

(Song: Everyday)

(Mr. Bolton comes on stage)

Mr. Bolton: I thought you told me you weren�t having fun here! Could have fooled me!

(Mr. Evans walks on stage)

Mr. Evans: I�ve been talking to the committee. It�s pretty much unanimous! Doesn�t matter what happens on court next year. We want Troy at U. of A. Full boat. Just the kind of kid we want on campus!

Mr. Bolton: Well, Troy will need to think about his options. Too early to tell. Summer�s just starting!

(Mr. Bolton and Mr. Evans walk offstage)

(Mr. Fulton comes on stage)

Mr. Fulton: Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of this year�s Star Dazzle award is, of course, our one and only��

(Sharpay Evans grabs microphone)

Sharpay Evans: Mr. Ryan Evans!

(Sharpay Evans gives award to Ryan Evans)

(Ryan Evans and Kelsi Nielsen kiss!)

Zeke Baylor: Chocolate �clair?

Sharpay Evans: How did you know that was my favorite?

Zeke Baylor: Wild guess! Maybe it was the three you are before the show!

(The next day at the Pool Party with everyone)

(Song: All For One)

(On the golf course at night with Troy Bolton, Gabriella Montez, Chad Danforth, Taylor McKessie, Sharpay Evans, Ryan Evans, Kelsi Nielsen, Zeke Baylor, Jason Cross and Martha Cox)

Troy Bolton: Man, what a party!

Chad Danforth: Glad we don�t have to clean it up!

Taylor McKessie: Actually, I think we do.

Gabriella Montez: But not until tomorrow!

Zeke Baylor: When we�re back on the clock��

Kelsi Nielsen: ��and getting paid!

Sharpay Evans: I�ll help clean up!
(Everyone looks at her)

Sharpay Evans: Did I say that?

(Everyone runs on the golf course)

(Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez stay on hill)

Gabriella Montez: Here�s to our future

Troy Bolton: No, here�s to right now

(Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez kiss)

(The sprinklers come on)

(Sharpay Evans and Zeke Baylor kiss, Taylor McKessie and Chad Danforth kiss, Ryan Evans and Kelsi Nielsen kiss, and Jason Cross and Martha Cox kiss) 

THE END!!!
