TIMON: Ah, Pumbaa look at that little guy. A chip off the old block! And you gotta know who's gonna raise 'im.
PUMBAA: His parents?
TIMON:
RAFIKI:
TIMON:.Girl.
TIMON and PUMBAA: Girl?!.Oy! Another Cub
RAFIKI: Asante sana Squash banana We we nugu Mi mi apana! Ooh, Mufasa! Such a day this has been! Princess Kiara's birth.another Circle of Life is complete, and the Pride's future is once again secure. Aaah! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Mufasa look what you are doing! The Circle is broken now. Why do you Ooh.there is trouble in the Pride Lands. There is another cub? Hmm.where could this be? In the Outlands.But that is where Simba banished Scar's followers. Including his most loyal.Zira.
KOVU: Rrrah!
ZIRA: Kovu! Don't let it go. What's the matter with you?
KOVU: But Mother! He wasn't hurting anyone
ZIRA: There is no room for weakness here, my son. Remember.Scar took you in and accepted you as his own son.
KOVU: But he wasn't my father.
ZIRA: No.but he chose you to become the next King. When you rule, we shall no longer be forced to live in these dry, barren, disgusting, pathetic, termite-infested Outlands!
NUKA and VITANI: Mother! Mother! Mother!
NUKA: We were there in the Pride Lands. We saw the whole thing!
VITANI: At Pride Rock. We saw everything!
NUKA and VITANI: We saw Simba's cub!
ZIRA: What? Vitani what did you see?
VITANI: Simba's new cub is a girl!
ZIRA: A girl! Scar, my beloved.did you hear that? This couldn't be more perfect.
NUKA: Who's she talking to?
VITANI: Ssshhh. Scar.
NUKA:
VITANI: Scar's dead.genius.
ZIRA: Yes! Because of Simba.if not for him, Scar would still be King. And I, Zira his loving, devoted Queen!
NUKA: You know, speaking of kings.I was thinking, since I am the oldest.maybe I should be King! Huh?
ZIRA: Uh? Don't be a fool, Nuka.
NUKA: Heh heh.just a thought.
ZIRA: Kovu is the chosen one. We must fulfill Scar's dying wish, and train Kovu to become King.
NUKA: Oh.yeah.oh, yeah. I can do that!
ZIRA: Look.at the Pride Lands, my pets. So green.so inviting. That is our home.that is where we belong. And soon, my beloved Scar.we shall reclaim your kingdom. Who Does She Remind You Of?
KIARA: Wow.
SIMBA: Whoah. Where do you think you're going in such a hurry?
KIARA: Daddy! Let go!
SIMBA: Well, I just want you to be careful. Kiara.are you listening? Accidents can happen. You could easily get hurt, or stepped
KIARA:.Hurt, or stepped on, or even get lost.
SIMBA: And remember,.I want you to stay in sight of Pride Rock at all
KIARA: At all times, I know. And if I see any strangers, don't talk to them. Come straight home. Okay, okay. Can I go now? Please?
SIMBA: Hmm. Very funny.
NALA:
KIARA:
SIMBA: And stay away from the Outlands.
ZAZU: Nothing there but a bunch of backstabbing, murderous Outsiders!
SIMBA: Zazu's right.you can't turn your back on them.
KIARA: Really? How come?
SIMBA: Mmm.never mind. Just run along now.
KIARA: But Dad, I
SIMBA: You'll understand someday. Go on.
KIARA: Dad.
SIMBA: And stay on the path I've marked for you!
NALA:
SIMBA:
NALA: She's just like you were when you were young.
SIMBA: Exactly. Do you realize the dangers we put ourselves in?
NALA: You mean the dangers YOU put us in.
NALA: She'll be fine.
SIMBA: Hey, Timon. Pumbaa. Come here.
TIMON: Good morning, mon Capitan.
SIMBA: I want you to keep a close watch on Kiara. You know she's bound to run off.
TIMON: No worries, Simba. We're on her like stink on a warthog!
PUMBAA: Hey!
TIMON: It's the hard truth, Pumbaa. Live with it.
SIMBA: Guys, I'm counting on you. Danger could be lurking behind every rock.
TIMON: Ah hah. 
KIARA: Hey! Wait! Come back! I just wanna play! Ahhh.the mighty hunter has cornered her prey. Errrrh!
KIARA: Whoah.cool! The Outlands! I wonder what's out there.
KIARA, TIMON, and PUMBAA: Eeeeek! 
PUMBAA: Oooh, don't worry, Kiara Uncle Pumbaa's comin'!
TIMON: Oh, no.ohh.uh.uh.let's see, uh. Gee, Simba. The good news is, we found your daughter. The bad news is, we dropped a warthog on her. Is.there a problem with that?
PUMBAA:
TIMON: Pumbaa! Let me define babysitting!
PUMBAA:
KIARA: But.but.
TIMON: Hurt! Oh.Simba would kill us! You didn't slip a disc, did you?
KIARA: B-but
TIMON: Catch a fever? Get a hangnail?
KIARA: Nnngh! Timon.
TIMON: I had one once.
PUMBAA: Very painful.
TIMON: Excruciating!
TIMON: Darling.with your complexion, you should stay out of the sun. Whaaat? Do you wanna wrinkle?
KIARA: Would someone please just listen to me?
TIMON: I'm sorry; I wasn't listening. Did you say something, Princess?
KIARA: I'm not just a princess, you know. That's only half of who I am!
PUMBAA: Oh, uh.who's the other half?
KIARA: Uh.well, I, uh.um.
TIMON: Well, while you're figuring it out, let's eat. Grubs!
PUMBAA: The other white meat!
TIMON:
KIARA: Eww! Gross!
TIMON: No? How 'bout you, big boy?
PUMBAA:
TIMON: Not like.
TIMON and PUMBAA: Love!
TIMON:
PUMBAA: But you can't tell from the outside which are the real slimy ones!
TIMON: Slimy? Pumbaa.my corpulent compadre. It's the crunchy ones that make the meal!
PUMBAA: Slimy!.Slimy!.Slimy!.Slimy!.Slimy!.Slimy!.Slimy!.Less filling!.Less filling!.Less filling!.Less filling!.Low fat!
TIMON: Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Crunchy!.Tastes good!.Tastes good!.Tastes good!.Tastes good!.Check, please!
KOVU: Who are you, Pridelander?
KOVU: What are you doing?
KIARA: My father says to never turn your back on an Outsider!
KOVU: You always do what Daddy says?
KIARA: No!
KOVU: Bet you do. Bet you're Daddy's little girl! Ha ha! An Outsider doesn't need anybody. I take care of myself!
KIARA:
KOVU: Wuhh.waaaahh!
KIARA:
KOVU: That was a close one.
KIARA: Yeah.
KOVU and KIARA: Whooaaahhh.
KIARA: Hey.what about me?
KOVU: You gotta take care of yourself! I'll distract them. Run!
KIARA:
KIARA: Move it!
KIARA: I did it.I did it! 
KOVU: Hah!
KIARA: Whoah, man did you see the size of those teeth? They were goin' Rrrarrarrarr. He was just totally eatin' you up right there, and I jumped on his head and I bopped him so good
KIARA: We make such a good team! And you.you were really brave!
KOVU: Yeah.you were pretty brave too. My name's Kovu.
KIARA: I'm Kiara.
KIARA: Tag! You're it!
KIARA: Tag! You're it! You're it!
KIARA: Hello? You run, I tag.get it? What's the matter? Don't you know how to play?
SIMBA: Zira.
ZIRA: Simba!
ZIRA: Nala.
NALA: Zira.
TIMON: Timon, Pumbaa. Great. Now that we all know each other.GET OUTTA OUR PRIDE LANDS!
ZIRA: Your Pride Lands? These lands belonged to Scar.
SIMBA: I banished you from the Pride Lands! Now you and your young cub.get out!
ZIRA: Oh.haven't you met my son, Kovu? He was hand-chosen by Scar to follow in his pawprints.and become King!
TIMON: Pbbb! That's not a king.that's a fuzzy maraca!
ZIRA: Kovu was the last born before you exiled us to the Outlands, where we have little food, less water.
SIMBA: You know the penalty for returning to the Pride Lands!
ZIRA: But the child does not! However.if you need your pound of flesh.here.
SIMBA: Take him and get out. We're finished here.
ZIRA: Oh no, Simba.we have barely begun.
KIARA: Bye.
KOVU: Bye.
NALA: Simba?
SIMBA:
SIMBA: Kiara, what did you think you were doing? You could have been killed today.
KIARA: But Daddy, I I didn't mean to disobey
SIMBA: I'm telling you this because I love you. I don't wanna lose you.
KIARA: I know.
SIMBA: If something happened to you, I don't know what I'd do. One day I won't be here.and I need you to carry on in my place. You are part of the great Circle of
KIARA: Circle of Life. I know.
SIMBA: Exactly. And you need to be careful. As future Queen
KIARA: But what if I don't wanna be Queen? It's no fun.
SIMBA: That's like saying you don't want to be a lion. It's in your blood.as I am. We are part of each other.
SIMBA: As you go through life you'll see There is so much that we Don't understand And the only thing we know Is things don't always go The way we planned But you'll see every day That we'll never turn away When it seems all your dreams come undone We will stand by your side Filled with hope and filled with pride We are more than we are We are one
KIARA: If there's so much I must be Can I still just be me The way I am? Can I trust in my own heart Or am I just one part Of some big plan?
SIMBA: Even those who are gone Are with us as we go on Your journey has only begun Tears of pain, tears of joy One thing nothing can destroy Is our pride, deep inside We are one We are one, you and I We are like the earth and sky One family under the sun All the wisdom to lead All the courage that you need You will find when you see We are one
SIMBA: As long as you live here, it's who you are. You'll understand someday. A bird flutters by her, circles, and flies off over the Pride Lands into the sun. Kiara looks sadly thoughtful for a second, and then turns to face the sun. Sitting down, she looks at the ground for a second, ears flat, but then looks towards the sun, ears erect. Fade to black.} New Hope for the Outlanders
NUKA:
VITANI: Nuka! Where's Kovu? Did you leave him out there on his own again?
NUKA: Hey it's every lion for himself out here. That little termite's gotta learn to be on his own.
VITANI: Mother's gonna be mad. She told you to watch him!
NUKA: Oh, who cares? I should've been the chosen one. I'm the oldest, I'm the strongest, I'm the smartest Ooogh! These termites! 
NUKA:
VITANI: Yeah right. Why don't you tell that to her?
NUKA: Yeah? Don't think I won't!
VITANI: Oh yeah? Here's your chance.
NUKA: What? Oh.Mother! Mother, hi! Mother, I caught some field mice for your dinner, I left 'em by the, um.by the.okay.
VITANI: Hey, Kovu. You wanna.fight? 
ZIRA:
KOVU: It's not his fault! I went off on my own!
ZIRA: What were you doing?
KOVU: N-nothing!
ZIRA: Who has made us Outsiders?
KOVU: Simba!
ZIRA: Who killed Scar?
KOVU: Simba!
ZIRA: And what have I told you about them?
KOVU: Sorry, mother!.Sh-she didn't seem so bad. I thought we could be
ZIRA: Friends? You thought you'd get to the daughter. And Simba would welcome you with open arms? What an idea!. What an idea! You brilliant child I'm so proud of you! You have the same conniving mind that made Scar so.powerful.
NUKA: Yecch.
NUKA:
ZIRA: I now see the path to our glorious return to power!
KOVU: But I don't want
ZIRA: Hush! Hush, my little one. You must be exhausted.
ZIRA: Sleep, my little Kovu Let your dreams take wing One day when you're big and strong You will be a king
KOVU: Good night.
ZIRA: Good night, my little prince. Tomorrow, your training intensifies.
ZIRA: I've been exiled, persucuted Left alone with no defense When I think of what that brute did I get a little tense But I dream a dream so pretty That I don't feel so depressed 'Cause it soothes my inner kitty And it helps me get some rest The sound of Simba's dying gasp His daughter squealing in my grasp His lionesses' mournful cry That's my lullaby Now the past I've tried forgetting And my foes I could forgive Trouble is, I knows it's petty But I hate to let them live
NUKA: So you found yourself somebody who'd chase Simba up a tree
ZIRA: Oh, the battle may be bloody, but that kind of works for me The melody of angry growls A counterpoint of painful howls A symphony of death, oh my! That's my lullaby Scar is gone.but Zira's still around To love this little lad Till he learns to be a killer With a lust for being bad!
NUKA: Sleep, ya little termite! Uh I mean, precious little thing!
VITANI: One day when you're big and strong
ZIRA: You will be a king! The pounding of the drums of war The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
NUKA: The joy of vengeance
VITANI: Testify!
ZIRA: I can hear the cheering
NUKA and VITANI: Kovu! What a guy!
ZIRA: Payback time is nearing And then our flag will fly Against a blood-red sky That's my lullaby! Kiara's First Hunt
RAFIKI: Oh, Mufasa.every day Kiara grows more beautiful, into a Queen that will someday make us all very proud. But this cub Kovu grows stronger. And Zira fills his heart with hate. I am very worried, Mufasa. Things are not going well.
RAFIKI: Hmm? You have a plan?
RAFIKI: What? Kovu.Kiara.together? This is the plan? Are you crazy? This will never work! Oh, Mufasa, you been up there too long. Your head is in the clouds!
RAFIKI: Okay, okay, okay! Okay! All right okay! I don't think this is going to work.but I trust you. I just hope you know what you are doing!
ZIRA: You are ready! Nice.very nice. You have the same blackness in your soul that Scar had. What is your destiny?
KOVU: I will avenge Scar.take his place in the Pride Lands.
ZIRA: Yes! What have I taught you?
KOVU: Simba is the enemy.
ZIRA: And what must you do?
KOVU: I must kill him!
RANDOM LIONESSES: Wow, her first hunt! You must be so proud, Nala. Here she is!
RAFIKI: Kiara.
RANDOM LIONESSES: Good luck, Kiara! She'll be great. Her first hunt! You can do it! It's your day, Kiara. Good luck, Kiara!
SARAFINA: My, how you've grown!
NALA: You'll do just fine.
KIARA: Daddy.you have to promise to let me do this on my own. Promise?
SIMBA: All right.I promise.
SIMBA:
NUKA: Yeecch. This place is even creepier since the hyenas ran off.
VITANI:
NUKA:
NUKA: I just don't know why we have to be here, that's all. If Kovu was so special, why does he need us?.I never even had a CHANCE! Yaaah! 
VITANI: That's it! Now come on.Kiara has started her hunt. We have to move quickly.
NUKA: Oooh! Fire! 
TIMON: Tango-Charley-Alpha. What's your position?
PUMBAA:
TIMON: Why do I bother? Ah hah.
TIMON: This must be where the deer and the antelope play!
KIARA:
TIMON: Uh.shopping! We thought a nice pelt for the den.some throw pillows, a little potpourri.
KIARA: My father sent you. After he promised to let me do this on my own he lied!
TIMON: No.he just doesn't want you to get hurt!
KIARA: I should have known he'd never give me a real chance.
KIARA: I'll do this on my own. Away from the Pride Lands!
TIMON: Hey! Wait! Come back! Oh.who can keep track of her? Kiara come back! Oh.she's gone again! Somebody's gotta tie a boomerang around her neck! Somebody's gotta get a beeper for this kid!
NUKA: Let's light fire! Roasty toasty princess.roasty toasty princess. Hey, is it hot in here, or is that just me? Fire! Yowww!
VITANI:
ZIRA: The plan is in motion. Go!
ZAZU: Don't worry, Simba. She'll be fine. What could happen?
SIMBA: No.no! Kiara! Zazu! Fly ahead. Find her!
ZAZU:
KIARA: Where am I?
KOVU: You're safe.in the Pride Lands.
KIARA:
KOVU: I think I'm the one who just saved your life!
KIARA: Look! I had everything under control!
KOVU: Not from where I'm standing.
KIARA: Then move downwind.
KOVU: What are you doing?
KIARA:
SIMBA:
NALA: Kiara! You're all right.
KIARA: Father.how could you break your promise?
SIMBA: It's a good thing I did. I almost lost you. No more hunts for you; not ever!
KIARA: But I was doing just fine! Even before Kovu
SIMBA: Kovu? 
NALA:
RAFIKI: Hey! You! How dare you save the King's daughter?
SIMBA: You saved her? Why?
KOVU: I humbly ask to join your pride.
SIMBA:
KOVU: I have left the Outsiders. I am a rogue. Judge me now, for what I am.or am I to be blamed for a crime I didn't commit?
NALA: Simba.you owe him your daughter's life.
ZAZU: Mmm.yes, sire. Clearly we are in his debt.and royal protocol demands that all debts be paid. Though in this case you might want to make an exception.
SIMBA: Hmmm. My father's law will prevail. For now, I reserve judgment. We'll see who you really are.
ZAZU: Hmph! Riffraff. An Unwelcome Stranger
KIARA: Hey.uh, thanks for saving me today.
KOVU: What kind of hunter are you, anyway Princess? You almost got yourself killed out there.
KIARA: What?
KOVU: You wouldn't last three days on your own.
KIARA:
KOVU: Heh.yeah.
SIMBA: Kiara!
KIARA: Coming! All right impress me. We start at dawn.
KOVU:
NUKA: Oh.oh.d-d-did you see that?! He let her go! If that were me
ZIRA: Hush. The fire-rescue worked perfectly, and Simba fell for it. Now, the closer Kovu gets to the daughter, the closer he gets to Simba! And once he has Simba alone.rraaagh! 
MUFASA: Simba! Simba! Help me!
SIMBA: Father!
SIMBA: Dad.just.a little.farther.
SCAR: Gotcha!.Trust me.
MUFASA: Simba!
SIMBA: Noooo!
SIMBA: Scar!
SIMBA: Kovu.?
KIARA: G'morning! I'm ready for my first lesson.
KIARA:
KIARA:
KOVU:
KIARA: Gotcha!
KIARA:
KOVU: Only.a lot. You're still breathing too hard. Relax.feel the earth under your paws.so it doesn't shift and make noise. Ssshh. Watch the master.and learn.
TIMON: Aaaahhhh!
TIMON: Don't eat me! Please! I.I.I never really met your tyrant. I mean, uh Scar. Scar. Oh, heck of a guy. A little moody, but, I.
KIARA: Timon! What are you doing here?
TIMON: Kiara! Thank goodness! Ohh! Hey.for once, we're not following ya. This just happens to be the best smorgasbord in the Pride Lands. Bugs everywhere! But, you don't call for a reservation, and yeesh! {turning toward the birds Get outta here, ya scavengers. Go on! Shoo! Shoo!
TIMON:
PUMBAA: Ohh.Timon, I'm getting tired. I gotta lose some pounds!
TIMON:
PUMBAA: Hey! Maybe he can help. Ya think?
TIMON: Shoo! Oh! Yeah.there's an idea. Right. Let the vicious Outsider Hey! Wait! I have an idea! What if he helps?
PUMBAA: What?
TIMON:
KIARA: Like this. 
TIMON: Wooo hoo! C'mon, do it again! Do it again!
TIMON: Yee-haa!
KOVU: Why are we doing this? What's the point of this training?
KIARA:
KOVU:
TIMON: Ya gotta get out more often. Fun! Yeee-haa! Ha ha ha ha.Woooo-hoo!
KOVU:
KOVU: Yeeeee-haaa!
KIARA: Uh-oh.
BIRDS:
TIMON:
KOVU: What a blast!
PUMBAA: Oh.sorry.
TIMON:
KOVU:
TIMON:.You're okay.
KIARA: Um.s-sorr uh.
TIMON: Hey! Are you two comin' or what? Upendi
KOVU: See that? See that? Look at that! It's really pretty.
KIARA: What? Oh yeah! Um look.there's one that looks like a baby rabbit. See the fluffy tail?
KOVU: Yeah.hey! There's one that looks like two lions killing each other for a scrap of meat!
KOVU: Ah, I've never done this before.
KIARA: Really? My father and I used to do this all the time. He says all the great Kings of the past are up there.
KOVU: You think Scar is up there?
KOVU: No one here thinks he's very great.do they? He wasn't my father, but he was still. part of me.
KIARA: My father said there was a.a darkness in Scar that he couldn't escape.
KOVU: Maybe there's a darkness in me too.
SIMBA: Father.I am lost. Kovu is one of them. Scar's heir. How can I accept him?
NALA: Simba?
SIMBA: I was.seeking counsel from the Great Kings.
NALA: Did they help?
SIMBA:
NALA: Oh, Simba.you want so much to walk the path expected of you. Perhaps Kovu does not.
SIMBA:
NALA:
KIARA: What's wrong?
KOVU: Nothing.
KIARA: Kovu.
KOVU: It's just that.my whole life I've been trained to. Nothing. I gotta go. 
KIARA: Kovu wait.
RAFIKI: And where are you going?
KOVU: Nuhh.nowhere.
RAFIKI:
KOVU:
KIARA: Uh. friend of the family.
RAFIKI: Come on! You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way!
KOVU:
RAFIKI: You follow you'll see! Hurry now!
KIARA:
KOVU: Where's he taking us?
RAFIKI: To a special place in your heart.called Upendi!
RAFIKI: There's a place where the crazy moon Makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom Will carry you away Where the hippos swing from the jungle vines And the rhino rhumba in a conga line And the pink flamingoes are intertwined As the stars come out to play In Upendi Where the passionfruit grows sweet And it's so divine That you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two To make it true Your heart will lead you there
KIARA: Where is it?
RAFIKI: No place you don't take with you.You better watch your step 'cause the path is steep Better hold your breath cause the water's deep It's a long way down over Lovers' Leap But falling's half the fun! In Upendi Where the passionfruit grows sweet And it's so divine That you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two To make it true Your heart will take you there You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow From Tanganyika to Kilimanjaro But you'll find Upendi wherever you are Oh underneath the sun
KIARA: Upendi it means love, doesn't it?
RAFIKI: Welcome to Upendi!
RAFIKI and CHORUS: In Upendi Where the passionfruit grows sweet And it's so divine That you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet
RAFIKI and KIARA: In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two To make it true Your heart will take you there
KIARA: Upendi!
RAFIKI, KIARA, and CHORUS: Down In Upendi Way down In Upendi!
KOVU: Good night.
KIARA: Good night.
SIMBA: It's.kinda cold tonight, huh? Come on.
VITANI:
ZIRA:
VITANI: Affirmative. I saw it with my own eyes.
ZIRA: Kovu cannot betray us! Deception and Disgrace
KOVU: Okay I have to tell her today. Oh.where do I start? Kiara.Zira had a plot and I was part of it. But I don't wanna be, because it's because I love you. Oh, she'll never believe me. But I gotta try.
KOVU: Kiara.I need to talk to you.
SIMBA:
SIMBA: Scar couldn't let go of his hate.and in the end, it destroyed him.
KOVU: I've.never heard the story of Scar that way. He truly was a killer.
SIMBA: Fire is a killer. Sometimes, what's left behind can grow better than the generation before.
SIMBA:.If given the chance.
KOVU: No.oh, no.no.
ZIRA: Why, Simba.
SIMBA: Zira.
ZIRA: What are you doing out here, and so alone? Well done, Kovu.just like we always planned.
SIMBA:
KOVU: No! I didn't have anything to do with this!
ZIRA: Attack!
KOVU: No!
ZIRA: Yes! We've got him!
ZIRA: Remember your training! As a unit!
KOVU: Simba!
ZIRA: Get him! Kovu! Get him! Do it now!
NUKA: I'll do it for you, Mother! Mother are you watching? I'm doing it for you.and I'm doing it for me!
NUKA: This is my moment of glory!
ZIRA: Nuka.
NUKA:
ZIRA: Ssshh.
NUKA: Well.I finally got your attention, didn't I.
NUKA: Didn't I.
VITANI: Nuka.
KIARA: Father. Father! Zazu, get help!
ZAZU:
KIARA: Father.?
TIMON: Simba! Talk to me! What happened?
SIMBA:
KIARA: No.
TIMON: It's all right, buddy.we're here for you.
ZIRA: Scar.watch over my poor Nuka. You!
KOVU: Eeaugh!
ZIRA:
KOVU: I-I-I didn't mean to.it-it-it wasn't my fault, I. I did nothing!
ZIRA: Exactly! And in doing so, you betrayed your pride.betrayed Scar!
KOVU:
ZIRA: You cannot escape it! Nuka is dead because of you!
KOVU: No.
ZIRA: You've killed your own brother!
KOVU: No!
ZIRA: Let him go. Simba has hurt me for the last time.now he's corrupted Kovu! Listen to me.Simba is injured and weak. Now is the time to attack! We will take his entire kingdom.by force!
KIARA: Daddy.it can't be true.
CHEETAH: It's Kovu. What's he doing here?
GIRAFFES: That's Kovu.
RANDOM ANIMALS: Look at that scar.I can't believe he's here. That's Kovu?
KIARA: Kovu!
RANDOM ANIMALS: I never trusted him.It's the Outsider.it's that little troublemaker.
TIMON: Why I oughtta.let me at 'im! Let me at 'im! Here; hold me back.
PUMBAA: Okay!
TIMON:
PUMBAA: Okay! 
TIMON:
PUMBAA: Uh.
RANDOM ANIMALS: What's he doing here?.He doesn't belong here.Look at that scar on his face.He looks just like Scar.
SIMBA: Why have you come back?
KOVU: Simba.I had nothing to do with
SIMBA: You don't belong here.
KOVU: Please.I ask your forgiveness.
KIARA: Daddy, please.listen to him!
SIMBA:
RANDOM ANIMALS: Give him what he deserves!
SIMBA:.And I pass it now.
RANDOM ANIMALS: Kick him out! That's right! Judgment day is here!
SIMBA: Exile!
KIARA: No!
